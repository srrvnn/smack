        <!-- Date: 16-09-2001 :: Pg: 01 :: Col: b --> </font></p><p><font size="3"> WASHINGTON, SEPT. 15. The President George W. Bush vowed on Saturday that U.S. troops would hunt down terrorists and ``smoke them out of their holes'' in a long, unrelenting response to Tuesday's ghastly attacks. Americans must brace themselves for great sacrifices, he said, ``because the conflict will not be easy.'' He said simply: ``We're at war.'' </font></p><p><font size="3"> The President's spokesman said Mr. Bush had not ruled out using ground troops in his planned war on global terrorism. </font></p><p><font size="3"> For the first time, Mr. Bush identified Osama bin Laden as a suspect in the attacks on Washington and New York, plus the downing of a commercial plane over Pennsylvania. </font></p><p><font size="3"> ``If he thinks he can hide and run from the United States and our allies he will be sorely mistaken,'' the President said. </font></p><p><font size="3"> ``Those who make war against the United States have chosen their own destruction.'' </font></p><p><font size="3"> Echoing the words of his father, the former President, Mr. George Bush, after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, the President said, ``This act will not stand'' and vowed vengeance for the worst terrorist attack on America. </font></p><p><font size="3"> ``We will find those who did it. We will smoke them out of their holes, we'll get them running, and we'll bring them to justice. We will not only deal with those who dare attack America, we will deal with those who harbour them and feed them and house them,'' he said. </font></p><p><font size="3"> ``They have stirred up the might of the American people,'' Mr. Bush said as he met with his National Security team at the Marine-guarded Camp David presidential retreat in western Maryland. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Mr. Bush met with his top advisers, including the Vice-President, Mr. Dick Cheney, the Secretary of State, Gen. Colin Powell, the National Security Adviser, Ms. Condoleezza Rice, the Defence Secretary, Mr. Donald H. Rumsfeld, and the Attorney General, Mr. John Ashcroft. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Prolonged war </font></p><p><font size="3"> Mr. Bush warned that the war would be prolonged and carry great risks. </font></p><p><font size="3"> ``I will not settle for a token act. Our response must be sweeping, sustained and effective,'' the President said in his weekly radio address. ``We have much to do and much to ask of the American people.'' </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> ``You will be asked for your patience, for the conflict will not be short. You will be asked for resolve, because the conflict will not be easy. You will be asked for your strength because the course to victory may be long,'' he said. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Mr. Bush moved from consoling a heartbroken nation to readying Americans for a new kind of war, calling 50,000 military reservists to duty and shouting words of defiance amid the ruins of the World Trade Center. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Standing on rubble amid cheers ``USA! USA!'' Mr. Bush vowed that the attackers of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon &quot;will hear all of us soon.'' </font></p><p><font size="3"> Visiting &quot;ground zero'' of Tuesday's terror attacks, Mr. Bush was mobbed by weary rescuers offering him a warm welcome in front of the smoking ruins of the collapsed twin towers yesterday. </font></p><p><font size="3"> After shaking hands and slapping the backs of dozens of rescuers in hard hats, Mr. Bush climbed atop a soot-covered, gnarled remnant of the north tower and addressed the throng through a bullhorn. </font></p><p><font size="3"> &quot;I want you all to know that America this day is on bended knee in prayer for the people whose lives were lost here, the workers who work here, for the families.&quot; </font></p><p><font size="3"> ``I can hear you,'' Mr. Bush said on Friday. ``The rest of the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.'' </font></p><p><font size="3"> Meanwhile, a senior State Department official met with 15 Arab representatives and told them they must declare their nations part of an international coalition against terrorism, or run the risk of being isolated in the growing conflict. </font></p><p><font size="3"> A report from Islamabad, quoting The News daily, said that according to unofficial reports, a contingent of over 50 personnel from the special services group of the U.S. Marines &quot;Green Seals&quot; had landed for conducting &quot;target oriented&quot; operations against Osama bin Laden. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Suspect arrested </font></p><p><font size="3"> In the U.S., the first arrest in the investigation came on Friday. The suspect, whose identity was not made public, was arrested because authorities believe he has information about the attacks and poses a high risk of fleeing the country. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Two other men picked up in Fort Worth, Texas, were flown to New York for questioning, officials said. </font></p><p><font size="3"> A report from Berlin said German authorities today identified a third terrorism suspect who lived in Germany and seized new evidence in the investigation into links to the attacks in the U.S. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Ziad Jarrah, who flew on a plane that crashed in a field 130 km from Pittsburgh, was reported missing by his girlfriend in the western industrial city of Bochum, the federal prosecutor's office said in a statement. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Jarrah had lived for a time in Bochum, said the agency, which is heading the criminal investigation in Germany. It said he left Germany in June 2000 and attended two flying schools in Florida. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The announcement widens the scope of the German investigation, which has focused so far on Hamburg. Two men believed to have been on a plane that hit the World Trade Center had lived in the port city. </font></p><p><font size="3"> - AP, Reuters </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font>
