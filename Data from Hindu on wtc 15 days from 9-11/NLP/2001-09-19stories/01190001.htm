        <!-- Date: 19-09-2001 :: Pg: 01 :: Col: b --> </font></p><p><font size="3"> By B. Muralidhar Reddy </font></p><p><font size="3"> ISLAMABAD, SEPT. 18. As the world watched with bated breath for the decision of the Taliban militia on handing over Osama bin Laden, prime suspect in last week's terrorist attacks in the U.S., the much-publicised meeting of the grand council of clerics, scheduled to take place at Kabul today, was postponed by a day. Meanwhile, the Pakistani delegation returned here tonight apparently without much success in its mission. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The ostensible reason for putting off the meeting was that some clerics, who are arriving from various provinces of Afghanistan, could not reach Kabul. </font></p><p><font size="3"> It was evident from the remarks of the Pakistan Foreign Office spokesman at a crowded news conference earlier in the day that the Musharraf Government has delivered a blunt message to the Taliban chief, Mullah Mohammad Omar, on the inevitability of a massive American retaliation if Osama was not handed over. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The Taliban continued to harp on ``conclusive and credible evidence'' against Osama for his alleged involvement in acts of terrorism as a precondition for handing him over. Reports from Kabul said that the militia had appealed to the people to enrol to wage a jehad in the event of an attack by the U.S. and its allies. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The fact that the Pakistani delegation returned without waiting for the outcome of the clerics meet does not augur well for peace in the region. The comments of the U.S. Defence Secretary that Washington would not be satisfied with the surrender of Osama further reinforced the perception. </font></p><p><font size="3"> A senior Government official declined to comment on whether the return of the delegation meant failure on its part. The Foreign Office spokesman was at pains to emphasise that the Musharraf regime was not engaged in any dialogue with the Taliban on the issue and it had gone with a clear cut message. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Taliban sets terms? </font></p><p><font size="3"> Reports from Afghanistan and a section of the Pakistani press talked about the Taliban putting forth a set of conditions for the extradition of Osama. These included the trial of Osama in a ``neutral'' country, the lifting of U.N. sanctions, the suspension of aid and military supplies to the opposition Northern Alliance and international recognition for the militia. </font></p><p><font size="3"> There was no confirmation or denial of the reports. The Pakistan Foreign Office spokesman said he was not aware of the details of the discussion between their delegation and the Taliban authorities. But he insisted that Pakistan was not engaged in any dialogue for a deal involving the Taliban. </font></p><p><font size="3"> ``As a friend and well-wisher of the Afghanistan President, Gen. Pervez Musharraf sent a high-level delegation with a special message. The message conveyed in stark terms the gravity of the situation and acts in conformity with the expectations of the international community. It is for the Afghanistan leadership to take a decision. We hope they take a decision in the interest of the people of Afghanistan,'' he said. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The spokesman also clarified that the Pakistani delegation had neither set a deadline nor given an ultimatum to the Taliban on Osama. His observations came amid reports of protests within the country over the prospect of Pakistan allowing its soil to be used by foreign forces against Afghanistan. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Musharraf continues talks </font></p><p><font size="3"> Gen. Musharraf, meanwhile, continued consultations with groups within Pakistan and representatives of friendly countries. A special envoy of the Chinese Government was among those who met him today. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The Pakistan Foreign Minister, Mr. Abdul Sattar, had contradicted reports in a section of the press on Monday that Gen. Musharraf had cancelled his scheduled visit to Beijing for urgent discussions with the Chinese leadership. The Foreign Office spokesman did not give any details of the nature of discussions between the envoy and Gen. Musharraf. ``We are interested in their views and they are interested in ours,'' was his reply when asked if the Chinese envoy had come to convey the concerns of China on possible American strikes. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The spokesman denied reports about presence of U.S. military experts in Pakistan in preparation for the strikes. ``To the best of our knowledge, the U.S. has not worked out any contingency plans.'' </font></p><p><font size="3"> `Osama has fled' </font></p><p><font size="3"> There were conflicting reports about the whereabouts of Osama in Afghanistan. A section of the local press claimed that the Saudi dissident had taken leave of his 500 suicide fighters, known in Arabic as `fidayeen', and fled on horses to an unknown destination. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Already reports had appeared in the local media two days ago that Osama, along with his four wives and children, had left his base in Kandahar and gone into hiding. </font></p><p><font size="3"> In another development, the Pakistan newspaper, Dawn, quoting senior law enforcement officials said that a contingency plan had been prepared to protect Gen. Musharraf, the U.S. embassy and U.S. citizens from suicide attacks. The American school in Islamabad has been closed for a day tomorrow as religious activists are planning a demonstration outside the U.S. Embassy. </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font>
