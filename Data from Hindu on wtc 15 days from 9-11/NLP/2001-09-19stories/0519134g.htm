      <!-- story begins --> <h3> <font color="blue"> Clash of terrors? </font> </h3> <p> <font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> 
        <!-- Date: 19-09-2001 :: Pg: 13 :: Col: e --> </font></p><p><font size="3"> By Swami Agnivesh &amp; Rev. Valson Thampu </font></p><p><font size="3"> The U.S. is deeply hurt. We all are. What happened on Black Tuesday is a nameless abomination. But hurt and humiliation, no matter how gigantic, are no excuse for embracing the logic of terror. The battle against terrorism must be won first in the mind. It is here that we seem to be losing out. A pall of inexorability is descending upon us. Not only the people of America and the likely victims of retaliatory strikes, the whole of the global community is drifting towards an adventure of </font></p><p><font size="3"> unimaginable proportions. We are worried. </font></p><p><font size="3"> President Bush provided the early clue. ``We shall make no distinction,'' he declared, ``between terrorists and those who harbour them.'' This leaves us in no doubt that the American goal will exceed the need to book Osama bin Laden and take out his sanctuaries. The nightmarish reality is that Osama's sanctuaries are reportedly spread over quite a few countries. All of them happen to be Muslim nations. This could drag the U.S. and its allies into a prolonged, and possibility interminable, war with a host of nations. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Viewed against this grim background, the Huntington hypothesis emerges as a self-fulfilling prophecy of doom. It is this very synergy between the emerging scenario and the U.S. foreign policy predilections reflected in the Huntington hypothesis that makes us worry. </font></p><p><font size="3"> But for Huntington's patently fanciful and wilfully mischievous thesis, the U.S. Administration's swagger of rooting out terrorism worldwide need not have evoked the intuitions of an impending holocaust. It is incredible and scary how facilely the so-called intellectuals see the present situation in terms of a civilisation conflict between Islam and Christianity. Among other things, this outlook thrives on the idiocy of equating the madness of some terrorists with Islam. Even more objectionably, it equates American interests with Christianity, whereas the two are utterly incompatible. What is unfolding itself is not a civilisational conflict, but an uncivilized and anti- civilisational conflict between two dominant but unequal interest groups into the maelstrom of which the rest of the world is being dragged as partisan players. President Bush projects the war against terrorism as a war in defence of democracy. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The Taliban, in turn, is busy persuading the rest of the Muslim world on the need to unite and defeat the Enemy of Islam. America's commitment to democracy is of a piece with the Taliban's understanding and espousal of Islam, of which the blasting of the Bamiyan Buddhas is a characteristic expression! The American fondness for democracy is, as the whole world knows, flexible enough to prop up civil and military dictatorships to bolster American interests. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Religion has become a haven for terrorists and criminals, cheats and charlatans, god-men and con-men. Conversely, by what courtesy of consideration can the Bush Administration or the NATO pretend to be the defenders of Christianity? And is it not an insult to Islam, the religion of peace, to even think of the Taliban and Osama bin Laden as the custodians of this great faith? </font></p><p><font size="3"> Afghanistan does not even pretend to be a democracy. It is a theocratic state, contemptuous of the will of the people. The unfortunate Afghans have already paid dearly for this. Now it seems unimaginable privations are going to visit them in the name of democracy and peace. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Three crucial issues emerge from the current scenario. First, the question of the unholy alliance between the states and religious fundamentalisms needs to be addressed as a global issue objectively and consistently. This is an issue of fundamental significance for democracy, especially in the Afro-Asian context. Increasingly in the developing world, religious fundamentalism finds encouragement through state partisanship. This promotes majoritarianism, with pronounced fascist overtones. This very state of affairs needs to be classified within the genre of terrorism. Understandably, this problem is more acute in the context of theocratic states. Islam, in particular, has been degraded as a mere appendix to the theocratic state and all authentic Muslims need to see this as a serious religious aberration. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Second, the global community has to pay adequate attention to the predicament of the people caught in the cross- fire between armed ideological combatants. The real sufferers of the stand-off between Saddam and the U.S. Administration are the people of Iraq. Ironically, the more they are pounded and humiliated, the more they focus their hopes and aspirations on their leader. If the most powerful military alliance in the world has not succeeded in dislodging him, how can a helpless and terrified people be held responsible for keeping him? </font></p><p><font size="3"> Third, the fight against terrorism must be balanced with a commitment to address the legitimate grievances of people groups. Palestine is a case in point. The sight of Palestinians celebrating the tragedy in New York is a sad commentary on our world in which the burning issues of the people remain unattended for decades. It is this protracted neglect that provides the ideal breeding ground for terrorism. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The growing cynicism about dialogue is complemented by the rising faith in terror. This, more than anything else, encapsulates our civilisational crudity. In real terms the reigning creed at all levels is simply, ``might is right''. We shall ridicule ourselves by mistaking this clash of terrors for a clash of civilisations! </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font>
