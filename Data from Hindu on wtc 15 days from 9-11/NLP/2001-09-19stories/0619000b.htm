        <!-- Date: 19-09-2001 :: Pg: 19 :: Col: a --> </font></p><p><font size="3"> By S. Swaminathan </font></p><p><font size="3"> The terrorist devastation of the World Trade Center in New York on September 11 and the attack on the Pentagon in Washington, have enormously complicated the arduous challenge of warding off a global-level economic meltdown. Economic analysts are not all gripped by a fatalistic belief that the U.S. economy will sink into a prolonged recession and that a worldwide slowdown will be an inescapable reality in less than a year. Professional opinion is not all that rare which expects reconstruction spending in the U.S. to reactivate the gigantic economy, sooner rather than later. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Financial markets, all over the world, have been deeply engulfed in gloomy sentiments. The high levels of integration of global financial and stock markets make it certain that panic travels much faster than the willingness of key players to make sober assessments of economic fundamentals. If investors, especially institutional investors, find it difficult to stay composed in the midst of market turbulence, it is hardly surprising that government policymakers and corporate business leaders get easily drawn into a mood of helplessness or of staying in a ``wait and see'' mode, without realising that inaction itself makes for a further aggravation of economic distress. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Ordeal for Vajpayee Government </font></p><p><font size="3"> It was after months of neglect of economic management owing to the enactment of the Agra Summit and the many interruptions to governance as a result of coalition bickerings and the Tehelka expose that the Prime Minister became acutely aware that the economy was showing unmistakable signs of faltering. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Not even the rumpus caused by the UTI - US-64 crisis could whip up some earnestness on the part of the Government to assume firm control over economic policy. </font></p><p><font size="3"> That the GDP growth rate had declined to 5.2 per cent in 2000-01, from 6.4 per cent in the previous year and the forecasts for 2001-02 were uniformly demoralising, seemed not to have rattled up Vajpayee administration which merely invested hopes in a turnaround in agriculture thanks to an expected favourable monsoon. Not even the absurdity of large food stocks remaining irrelevant to massive poverty was enough to stir the Government to some unseasonable bout of well-directed activity! </font></p><p><font size="3"> It is in this background that the whirl of consultations and meetings which the Prime Minister and his senior Cabinet colleagues had, in the earlier weeks of September, is to be seen. First came the media reports of a dinner meeting of the Prime Minister with more than a dozen of his own Cabinet colleagues. </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> The refrain at this meeting was that many ministries had not carried out programmes for which the budget for 2001-02, had funded them. One report said that about Rs. 50,000 crores of allotted funds were remaining unutilised with the ministries of the Centre at the end of June 2001, representing around 25 per cent of the total budgeted expenditure for the whole year. At a time when the economy was suffering from a deficiency of demand, it was imperative that the Government translated promptly its various programmes. In particular, project implementation in key areas such as railways, highways, power and ports, needed to be speeded up. </font></p><p><font size="3"> India Inc. recipes </font></p><p><font size="3"> The Prime Minister's Advisory Council on Trade and Industry, on its part, seems to have reminded the Government that the economy needed immediate, multi-pronged measures for its resuscitation. The idea that public investments hold the key to the revival of aggregate demand and its corollary of pump-priming, with a clear focus on rural infrastructure, appears to have been cogently put across to the Government by the captains of industry. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Project implementation - the bugbear of the coalition Government - also seems to have been stressed upon. While the corporate business leaders appear to have focussed on ``the here and now'' policy actions needed to get the economy back to a reasonable growth momentum, the Finance Ministry apparently chose to emphasise the reform agenda covering such areas as labour laws, downsizing of Government and privatisation of public sector enterprises. Interest rate and exchange rate policy - the twin mandates of the monetary authorities, seemed not to figure prominently in the discussions although the Reserve Bank of India is reported to have taken the stand that interest rates have already softened and that right now the constraint on investment is neither liquidity nor money cost, but the depressed outlook stemming from deficient demand. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Economists stuck in the mud? </font></p><p><font size="3"> When all pointers are that Government spending needs to be accelerated on the multiple segments of infrastructure, particularly rural infrastructure, without obsessive concerns for numbers and percentages of fiscal deficit, the Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council appears to have stuck the much-too conventional if not orthodox note, that in the ultimate analysis, it is the containment of the fiscal deficit, which would be the crucial criterion of economic management. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The council seemed not to worry as much about the current predicament of economic slowdown as much as it would appear to be concerned with the medium-term strategies needed to stimulate private sector investment. A reform mindset not amenable to the vicissitudes of political economy but swearing by the imperatives of structural transformation of the economy? One can only pity Vajpayee and Co. for they seem to be bombarded by conflicting economic prescriptions! And now that the campaign for capturing Osama Bin laden is becoming paramount priority of the international community, is there the distinct possibility that the Vajpayee Government will leave the domestic economy to fend for itself, leaving it at the mercy of the monsoons and that of the non-government sector? </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font>
