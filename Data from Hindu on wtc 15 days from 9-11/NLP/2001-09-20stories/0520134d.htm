      <!-- story begins --> <h3> <font color="blue"> Osama, Dawood - an ironic parallel </font> </h3> <p> <font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> 
        <!-- Date: 20-09-2001 :: Pg: 13 :: Col: f --> </font></p><p><font size="3"> By Mahesh Vijapurkar </font></p><p><font size="3"> MUMBAI, SEPT. 19. If Osama bin Laden is only a ``prime suspect'' and Afghanistan is being asked to ``hand him over,'' then how come Pakistan, which is reported to be harbouring Dawood Ibrahim, the prime accused in the March 12, 1993 Mumbai serial blasts, is not being forced to return him to India? Curiously enough, Pakistan which told the Home Minister, Mr. L.K. Advani, that Dawood was not there, has been asked to issue the ultimatum to Afghanistan. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The irony is not lost here. Mumbai went through a horrendous experience - 257 deaths and several hundreds injured when RDX explosions were triggered at public places, including the Bombay Stock Exchange and the Air India building, by persons working for Dawood and his key henchmen, Tiger Memon and Chota Shakeel. Those involved in the investigation and the prosecution of the case can wonder if Dawood would ever be brought to justice here. In November 1993, the chargesheet filed by the Mumbai Police and Central Bureau of Investigation was replete with references to Dawood as the brain behind the entire episode. The Mumbai blasts and the attacks in the U.S. bear substantial parallel - except for the number of deaths and the method of the strikes. In comparison, while only persons alleged to be associates of Osama are said to be involved in the attacks on the U.S., Dawood's involvement in the blasts here has been well established. </font></p><p><font size="3"> It is argued here that Dawood's deeds were an atypical instance of mass murder through a wide and well-laid-out conspiracy using persons aggrieved by the 1992-93 communal riots. The Justice Srikrishna Commission ``was inclined to agree'' that all this was ``a reaction to the totality of events at Ayodhya and Bombay'' in December 1992 and January 1993. </font></p><p><font size="3"> If Osama has to be brought to justice on what is now a strong suspicion then Pakistan, by the same logic, should send Dawood back for being incarcerated in a Mumbai jail as an undertrial appearing before the designated court. </font></p><p><font size="3"> But Pakistan fobbed off Mr. Advani when he met Gen. Pervez Musharraf in Delhi but later a Pakistani publication gave details of Dawood's vast property and network which he deploys to virtually recreate another new underworld in Karachi. Dawood's lifestyle was also written about which is similar to the manner in which he lived in Dubai, well out of reach of India, and as he does now in Pakistan. </font></p><p><font size="3"> It is a matter of faith that Dawood's continuing control of the underworld here - the way he controls financial inputs into film production and gets money by extortion - would be neutralised if he was brought to book on one charge or the other. But then, there are fears that he may never be. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Would the U.S. President, Mr. George W. Bush's often repeated reference to ``do whatever it takes'' to run down terrorists amount to even asking Pakistan to hand over to India Dawood and his henchmen who are in Karachi where they get official protection? If it does not happen, observers argue, then what is being said is only posturing by the U.S. to get others to cooperate with it in its retaliation to the September 11 attack and nothing more. </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font>
