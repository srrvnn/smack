      <!-- story begins --> <h3> <font color="blue"> Memories of another day </font> </h3> <p> <font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> 
        <!-- Date: 20-09-2001 :: Pg: 20 :: Col: a --> </font></p><p><font size="3"> Arvind Aaron, Chess Correspondent, The Hindu, who covered the PCA World chess championship match between Garry Kasparov and Viswanathan Anand at the World Trade Center in 1995, bemoans the WTC's demise as he pens memories of another day. </font></p><p><font size="3"> CHENNAI, SEPT. 19. The World Trade Center, New York, razed to the ground last week in terrorist strikes, was a historic venue for a World chess championship match. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The Intel-sponsored $ 1.5 million Professional Chess Association match between champion Garry Kasparov and Viswanathan Anand was played there in 1995. It is a shame that it was brought down by terrorists on September 11, 2001, the very same day six years ago when the match began. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Having covered the match for a month and a half from the Observation Deck (110th Floor) of the World Trade Center for The Hindu I feel compelled to recollect my feelings about this match in which Kasparov retained his title 10.5-7.5 with two games to spare. </font></p><p><font size="3"> When the venue for the match was changed from Cologne in Germany to New York, I was one of the several unhappy persons for we could only report the news after Indians back home would have known the result through radio and television news. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Once I arrived for the opening ceremony on September 10, 1995, a day before the first game, I knew that there couldn't have been a better venue. It was the best place to publicise the sport which deserved to be publicised. Also, I was present when Yugoslav Grandmaster Ljubomir Ljubojevic advised Vishy Anand at Monte Carlo in March 1995 to opt for a venue like England or U.S. which had a larger Indian community around for support. The venue was a novelty, quarter of a mile into the sky! The 110th floor had enough space to accommodate over 500 live spectators, a fish tank like playing cabin and private rooms for both players behind the stage. It had a VIP room for special spectators who could ask GM Yasser Seirawan questions. The pressroom was large and everything worked perfectly up there to make a specially extended deadline of 0130 IST which was one hour after the start of the games. </font></p><p><font size="3"> There were rumours that computer modems wouldn't work at `top of the world' but they functioned without a glitch. Our neighbouring room was occupied by securitymen but there was no need to worry. Although there was one terrorist attempt to blow up the building in 1993 we were not bothered as the match was too exciting with an Indian playing for the World title for the first time. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The building was visited by men in formal wear who were highly impersonal and who never ever bothered to notice what the other person did. There was a queue for the elevators and my laptop case was checked everyday and I had to open it for security inspection each day like everybody else. The elevator was an experience by itself as the ears start to react to the higher altitide, as it would on flights. </font></p><p><font size="3"> At the Observation Deck, we could look at all sides and that included some low flying planes, the airports and the Hudson Bay. On one occasion during the game, some of us climbed to the absolute top of the building on a staircase and you could almost touch the clouds. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The building was primarily office space for financial institutions, Government agencies, insurance companies, stock broking firms and law firms. The lobby had banks, bookstore, painting displays, travel, leatherware and medicine stores. The basement had a subway station from where one could depart to New Jersey or northwards into Manhattan. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The `Twin Towers', a landmark of the `Big Apple' which stood as a testimony of our times has been floored. It also took the lives of an estimated five thousand innocent souls from 62 countries. When I was waiting for my friend on Park Street on July 2 this year admiring the place where I once worked, I did not know that I wouldn't see these two architectural wonders again. The spot, where a silver beauty once stood in the heart of Manhattan, will in the future give an empty look on a crowded skyline of tall buildings. </font></p><p><font size="3"> An e-mail from a chess journalist in New York, Mr. Sam Sloan, read: ``I am going for a walk over what used to be the World Trade Center today.'' What would Agra look like if there was no Taj Mahal? Imagine former World champion Garry Kasparov telling his 4-year old son Vadim, ``It's up there that I beat the present World champion Viswanathan Anand in a match.'' He will have to point to the sky. </font></p><p><font size="3"> After becoming a victim of terror, one of the historic venues of a World chess championship match finds a special place in the hearts of those who saw the match, for it can never be recreated in the same manner. It is more than a workplace destroyed. </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font>
