        <!-- Date: 24-09-2001 :: Pg: 01 :: Col: b --> </font></p><p><font size="3"> By Sridhar Krishnaswami </font></p><p><font size="3"> WASHINGTON, SEPT. 23. The Bush administration has lifted sanctions against India and Pakistan, imposed in the aftermath of the 1998 nuclear tests. In a memorandum to the Secretary of State from Camp David, the U.S. President, Mr. George W. Bush, said the continuation of the punitive measures ``would not be in the national security interests of the United States.'' </font></p><p><font size="3"> Although India and Pakistan have been working hard in the last several months for the lifting of the sanctions, Mr. Bush's move came when a Pentagon delegation was heading for Pakistan to finalise the details and operational plans for a military strike on Afghanistan. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Reports said the U.S. delegation, comprising members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, other Pentagon offices and the intelligence community, would be meeting with their counterparts in Pakistan early this week. Originally, the Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia, Ms. Christina Rocca, was supposed to lead the delegation. But the Associated Press quoted an official as saying that since cooperation on the diplomatic front had already been worked out, the focus was on the military front as the details of the proposed operation were to be finalised. </font></p><p><font size="3"> As far as Pakistan is concerned, all sanctions relating to the development of nuclear weapons since the Symington Amendment of 1978, have been lifted. This also includes the 1990 Pressler and the 1998 Glenn Amendments, although the focus was on the latter imposed by the Clinton administration. </font></p><p><font size="3"> It follows that Pakistan is now eligible for economic assistance and the restriction on military sales to Islamabad stands removed. But what remain are the 1999 sanctions, imposed in the wake of the military coup of Gen. Pervez Musharraf. These include ineligibility for loans and a prohibition on Pakistan from sending its soldiers to the U.S. for training. The sanctions would have to be lifted by Congress after the White House gives Pakistan a `certification of democracy.' </font></p><p><font size="3"> There was hectic activity on Capitol Hill last week as the Bush administration went about the task of ``consulting'' Congress on the issue of lifting sanctions against India and Pakistan. The Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, Mr. Marc Grossman, held closed-door meetings with law makers of the House of Representatives and the Senate. </font></p><p><font size="3"> One version is that the administration wanted to get rid of sanctions from the statute books by way of a waiver. Apparently, there was opposition to this from those who wished to retain some leverage in case there were further nuclear tests in the subcontinent. Key Congress members like the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Joseph Biden, favoured the lifting of sanctions against Pakistan after its stance on fight against terrorism. (Mr. Biden had earlier expressed his reservations against lifting sanctions on Pakistan in a letter to Mr. Bush.) </font></p><p><font size="3"> In the backdrop of what has been going on here, there is tremendous appreciation in the administration and Congressional circles for the Pakistan President, Gen. Musharraf, and the extent to which he has come through against the Taliban and Osama. And Washington has also decided that Islamabad will get a hefty financial `rewards' package, the finer details of which are being worked out. </font></p><p><font size="3"> PTI reports: </font></p><p><font size="3"> On the lifting of sanctions against New Delhi, India's Ambassador to the U.S., Mr. Lalit Mansingh, said: ``The sanctions imposed in 1998 were economic, military and restrictions on dual use technology. Some of these had been removed by the former U.S. President, Mr. Bill Clinton. But some remained - like the lending by international financial institutions or foreign military sale or transfer of dual use technology... So we take it that these remaining restrictions have now been removed as a result of the presidential waiver.'' </font></p><p><font size="3"> The Secretary of State, Gen. Colin Powell, said the lifting of sanctions was partial. While the post-nuclear sanctions were being lifted, other sanctions would remain. </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font>
