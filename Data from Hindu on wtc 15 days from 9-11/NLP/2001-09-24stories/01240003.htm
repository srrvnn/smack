        <!-- Date: 24-09-2001 :: Pg: 01 :: Col: b --> </font></p><p><font size="3"> By Sandeep Dikshit </font></p><p><font size="3"> NEW DELHI, SEPT. 23. The U.S. decision to lift sanctions today gave rise to the hope that the long-delayed project to manufacture the light combat aircraft (LCA) could gather momentum. According to highly-placed sources, it may also help in the procurement of a variety of equipment, including radars and integrated command and control systems, from the U.S. </font></p><p><font size="3"> ``We are greatly enthused by the lifting of sanctions and are looking at the development positively,'' noted the Defence Secretary, Mr. Yogendra Narain. India had placed orders for several defence equipment but their supply from the U.S. got bogged down after the sanctions were imposed in 1998. ``With this development (the lifting of sanctions), we hope the supplies will be resumed,'' he said. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The lifting of curbs may also see the Sea King helicopters, which were sent to their British manufacturer for repairs around the time of the Pokhran tests, being refurbished. The company had refused to attend to the copters as it had shareholding from the American entities. </font></p><p><font size="3"> In the case of the LCA project, though India was working on inducting the indigenously-developed Kaveri engines, it was being hoped that the supplies of American-made GE-404 engines would resume ``so that the project is further accelerated,'' Mr. Narain said. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Dr. K. Santhanam, chief, Institute of Defence Studies and Analysis, who was earlier associated with the Defence Research &amp; Development Organisation (DRDO), was also positive about the impetus to the LCA programme though much depended on the finer details such as dependability of supplies. ``It is possible that the Indo-U.S. Governmental cooperation agreement for the LCA programme (signed in 1987) would be resumed to mutual benefit.'' </font></p><p><font size="3"> ``However, the U.S. may have to note that the first block of 10 flights of the LCA have been successful, despite the sanctions. As we proceed to the next phase of development, testing, manufacture etc.., it is quite likely that resumption of cooperation could be useful,'' he said. </font></p><p><font size="3"> ``Secondly, it is known that the ``broad brush'' coverage of Indian entities in Government, academia and industry (both public and private) had a very large number of anomalies. It is hoped that all these would have been removed.'' </font></p><p><font size="3"> Dr. Santhanam pointed out that in an inter-dependent environment, the U.S. might have to satisfactorily address the larger issue of reliability and stability of supplies as well as the sanctity of contracts. ``These continue to affect its image and the business prospects of the U.S. industry in high technology areas.'' </font></p><p><font size="3"> The Defence Ministry sources also expected the development to accelerate the acquisition of the advanced jet trainer (AJT) whose ``standard of preparation'' was affected because of the ban on sourcing components from the U.S. A new fighter trainer aircraft is necessary to replace the MiG-21 which has been found unsuitable for ``stage III'' training. </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font>
