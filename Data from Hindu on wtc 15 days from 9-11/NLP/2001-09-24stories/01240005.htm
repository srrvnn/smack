        <!-- Date: 24-09-2001 :: Pg: 01 :: Col: e --> </font></p><p><font size="3"> By B. Muralidhar Reddy </font></p><p><font size="3"> ISLAMABAD, SEPT. 23. Adding a new dimension to the ongoing confrontation between the United States and the Taliban regime in Afghanistan over the issue of handing over of the Saudi dissident, Osama bin Laden, the Taliban today maintained that it could not trace him. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The Taliban spokesman, Mr. Abdul Hai Mutmaen, told an international wire agency that the militia could not deliver the edict of the religious leaders urging the Taliban authorities to encourage Osama to leave Afghanistan voluntarily at the time of his choosing and to a destination of his choice. ``We have still not been able to deliver the clerics' message to him because we could not find him'', he was quoted as telling the wire agency over phone from Kandahar, the spiritual headquarters of the Taliban. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Significantly, the spokesman has also disclosed that the Taliban supremo, Mullah Omar, had accepted the recommendation made by the congregation of religious leaders three days ago urging the Taliban Government to encourage Osama to leave on his own free will. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The Taliban Ambassador to Pakistan, Mullah Abdul Saleem Zaeef, who confirmed the news here, has also claimed that the Taliban had recovered the wreckage of the unmanned spy plane shot down on Saturday. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The military establishment in Islamabad made it a point to urge the Taliban leadership to act immediately on the recommendation of the religious leaders and respond to the wishes of the international community. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The ``disappearance'' of Osama is not expected to make any material difference to the U.S. resolve to go after him in Afghanistan. The demands of the Bush administration go beyond the surrender of Osama. It wants access to all the associates of Osama, prime suspect in the September 11 terror attacks in New York and Pentagon, and to his networks. </font></p><p><font size="3"> It is not clear as to what the Taliban intended to convey to the U.S. and the rest of the world by giving an impression that it was unable to locate Osama. It is difficult to judge if it is an indication of the Taliban distancing itself from the man most wanted by the U.S. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The other way of looking at the development is that the Taliban wants to put pressure on the U.S. not to resort to any military action as Osama was out of its reach. Perhaps it is the Taliban's way of telling the world that the U.S. is bent on a campaign against it though Osama is untraceable. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Earlier in the day, the Taliban spokesman was quoted by the Afghan Islamic Press (AIP), a Peshawar-based news agency, as saying that there was no change in the Taliban's position on Osama. ``There is no change in our decision. American demands are not in favour of Muslims and Afghans and we are not ready to accept this,'' he said. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The latest developments came amidst reports of renewed fighting between the Taliban and the opposition forces led by the Northern Alliance. Reports from Afghanistan also suggested Taliban stepping up its preparedness to counter any military action by the U.S. and others. </font></p><p><font size="3"> It is very difficult to know what is actually going on inside Afghanistan as the entire foreign press has left the country on orders from the Taliban. The CNN team was perhaps the last of the foreign scribes to leave. Some of the international wire agencies have their stringers inside Afghanistan and they are believed to be feeding bits and pieces of information thanks to their access to satellite phones. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The Northern Alliance has claimed that it had launched a massive offensive in some of the provinces under the control of the Taliban. At the moment, the Taliban is supposed to be in control of 90 to 95 per cent of the territory in Afghanistan. The Northern Alliance has claimed that it had mounted attack on three provinces under the Taliban's control and wrested one district. </font></p><p><font size="3"> In another development, the Pakistan President's Principle Secretary, Mr. Tariq Aziz, has said that it would be his country's endeavour to ensure that the Afghan people did not suffer in any campaign against Osama. He has also indicated that a three-member U.S. team would soon visit Islamabad to discuss the details of cooperation. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Opposition claim </font></p><p><font size="3"> Reuters reports from Dushanbe: </font></p><p><font size="3"> Dr. Abdullah Abdullah, Foreign Minister of the Northern Alliance which is recognised as Afghanistan's Government by the United Nations, today said he believed that Osama was in hiding in southern Afghanistan with Mullah Omar and that he believed both could be found and captured. ``He is as dangerous as he used to be. He has gone into hiding along with Mullah Omar,'' Dr. Abdullah told a news briefing at the Afghan embassy. </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font>
