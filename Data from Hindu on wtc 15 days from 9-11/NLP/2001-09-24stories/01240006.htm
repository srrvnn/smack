        <!-- Date: 24-09-2001 :: Pg: 01 :: Col: e --> </font></p><p><font size="3"> By Sridhar Krishnaswami </font></p><p><font size="3"> WASHINGTON, SEPT. 23. The Bush administration has warned the Taliban again that it has a very clear choice between handing over Osama bin Laden or face the ``wrath'' of the international coalition; Washington has brushed aside the contention of Kabul that Osama is ``missing''; and has dismissed the Taliban calls for proof for the actions of Osama as ``somewhat misplaced.'' </font></p><p><font size="3"> The renewed warning to the Taliban was issued on Sunday morning by the senior members of the administration that took to the nation's top talk shows. They included the National Security Advisor, Dr. Condoleeza Rice, the Defence Secretary, Mr.Donald Rumsfeld and the Secretary of State, Gen. Colin Powell. </font></p><p><font size="3"> All this while the President, Mr. George W Bush, gets ready to return to the White House from Camp David to further continue discussions with his top aides on last minute preparations for military strikes against terrorist targets in Afghanistan. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Dr. Rice took the position that Osama and his lieutenants were only part of the story and that the U.S. objective in this campaign against terrorism was ``choking off'' the bloodlines. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Stressing that the campaign against terrorism was a global one, Dr. Rice argued that the President had a number of ``options and assets'' and that he would be making his final decision at the ``time of his choosing, not one minute before.'' The campaign to ``squeeze out'' the perpetrators of the September 11 acts has begun, she said. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Asked if the Bush administration believed the Taliban when it said that Osama was ``missing,'' Dr. Rice shot back, ``We don't simply believe it.'' Mr. Rumsfeld said the proposition was ``laughable.'' </font></p><p><font size="3"> Gen. Powell further toughened the rhetoric when he said that Osama should not be seen as a ``world hero'' as he was in some countries but as a ``murderer'' who had to be condemned as being against civilisation. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The tough comments of senior Cabinet members of the administration have to be seen in the backdrop of at least major developments that are taking place. First it has to do with the continued military build up in and around Afghanistan. The U.S. is said to have assembled a broad array of forces and military hardware; and the clear impression is that when the President gives the go-ahead, the retribution is going to be very severe and in a variety of ways. </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> Secondly, a high-level military delegation is on its way to Pakistan to finalise the finer details of the operations against Osama and the Taliban. To underscore the seriousness of the military nature of the discussions, the administration decided against having the team led by the Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia, Ms. Christina Rocca.The rationale has apparently been that the administration has sorted out issues on the diplomatic front with Pakistan. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The Pentagon continues to be tight-lipped on the kind of measures that are being put in place in the Persian Gulf, the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea. And Washington is downplaying the dissent from Saudi Arabia that it would not allow the Prince Sultan Air Base to be used by the U.S. for operations. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Senior administration officials like Gen. Powell are maintaining that Washington was getting very good cooperation from Saudi Arabia or the regime there was being ``very responsive'' even while ``details'' were being worked out. And on a different front, the reminder has been that military action is only one part of the ongoing campaign. </font></p><p><font size="3"> On Saturday, the President had his third conversation since the crisis began last week, with his Russian counterpart, Mr. Vladimir Putin. The telephone talk is said to have lasted 45 minutes, the length suggesting the kind of importance Mr. Bush is attaching to a role for Russia in the campaign against terrorism and terror networks. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The Bush administration is confident that Moscow will provide assistance by way of logistics, in the realm of intelligence sharing especially. Washington has a commitment from China as well and counter-terrorism and intelligence officials of the two countries are getting together here this week. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Mr.Bush has prominent foreign leaders visiting him this week as well. On Monday, the Canadian Prime Minister, Mr. Jean Chretien is in town; the Japanese Prime Minister, Mr.Junichiro Koizumi is coming to the White House on Tuesday. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The discussions with Mr. Chretien has additional significance in the sense that the administration is keen on taking steps to tighten things at the border, something that the Canadians are wary of, for political and economic reasons. There is a perception in some investigative agencies that the less-than- stringent mechanisms on the Canadian side of the border has led to instances of terrorists crossing to the U.S. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Further, the U.S. is keen on cooperation on immigration matters, something the Canadians are quite wary of as well, given their relatively liberal immigration and refugee policies. </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font>
