        <!-- Date: 24-09-2001 :: Pg: 12 :: Col: a --> </font></p><p><font size="3"> THE TERRORIST OFFENSIVE, which struck New York and Washington on September 11, seems to have affected the American social psyche in a disturbing way. Several minority groups within the United States, citizens and other residents have begun to feel a sense of insecurity. They are the victims of seemingly sporadic hate crimes that are being foolishly committed to avenge the simmering terrorist onslaught. At least three persons are reported to have been murdered in this spree of violence. One of them was an Indian-American belonging to the Sikh faith, and he might have been murdered in a case of mistaken identity. Surely, these hate crimes are no more than notoriously misguided acts of revenge for a horrific terror episode which the American officials tend to blame on Al Qaeda, a radical but external Islamic network linked to Osama bin Laden. Whatever the perceived provocation, the American authorities and community leaders at different strata will do well to intensify their efforts to sustain social harmony at home. A genuine healing touch, designed to soothe the ruffled feelings of the affected minorities, including the Arab-Muslims and the Indian-Sikh sections of the American society, can only enhance the credibility of Washington's stated resolve to protect the U.S. as also its external friends and allies from the growing scourge of international terror. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Sensing the potential danger to the multi-ethnic and multi- religious fabric of the American society, the U.S. President, Mr. George W. Bush, has paid a well publicised visit to the Islamic Center in Washington. In so doing, he sought to underline the social reality of America as a large-sized microcosm of the many races and faiths of the world. Now, in its short but variegated history, the U.S. has witnessed some traumatic phases and instances of racial and other forms of social bigotry. A major civil rights campaign and the portrayal of America as a `melting pot' as also a `great society' have at different times defined the cultural identity of the U.S. Yet, the Bush administration cannot simply afford to let the American tapestry fray at this critical moment when a possible move to eliminate an external Islamic outfit could encourage the fanatics within the U.S. to attack its own Muslims and their look-alike compatriots. Mr. Bush has consciously told the Muslims of the world that their faith has an honoured place in America too and that the terrorists, ``traitors to their own faith'', are ``trying, in effect, to hijack Islam itself''. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The Bush administration's task of sustaining the confidence of the entire American society is truly cut out. The Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Mr. Robert Mueller, has not only promised a quick probe into all allegations of hate crimes but also assured that no ethnic group would be the prime target of those unravelling the terrorist crimes of September 11. However, at least one U.S. Congressman has complicated Mr. Bush's anti- terror agenda by calling for an augmented surveillance over a particular social group for purposes of airport- security and the like. Although the Congressman has subsequently apologised for his insensitive remarks, the battle for the hearts and minds of some of America's minorities is still far from won. Mr. Bush has therefore taken a right step by assuring the Sikhs of America that their interests would be safeguarded. It was brought to his attention that the men among the Sikh community had become vulnerable to the senseless hate crimes on account of their beards and turbans which, to the untrained eye, might resemble those of Osama bin Laden and the Taliban clergy, his ``host'' in Afghanistan. On a different but related plane, the Indian diplomats in the U.S., too, seem to have intervened quite actively to try and place this issue in perspective. </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font>
