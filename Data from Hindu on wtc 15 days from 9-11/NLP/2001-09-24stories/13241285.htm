        <!-- Date: 24-09-2001 :: Pg: 27 :: Col: a --> </font></p><p><font size="3"> An evangelist in Bhopal </font></p><p><font size="3"> The evening I saw Dominique Lapierre at the Trident, he was an impassioned evangelist promoting I am not sure what... his latest book, an appeal based on &quot;all royalties from It was five past midnight in Bhopal to go towards rehabilitation of those affected by the Bhopal gas tragedy&quot;, the thought that &quot;we must never forget Bhopal&quot; or the world of do-goodism of which he is described as a shining light? Introducing an author who needed no introduction, his Indian publisher Shekhar Malhotra appeared to feel that Lapierre generating help for an India that will not help itself needed to be the focus. And so he narrated a couple of stories... </font></p><p><font size="3"> When shortly before Malhotra's Full Circle Publishing was to release Lapierre's earlier book, A Thousand Suns, they heard that pirated editions could well hit the stands before the authentic imprint. To counter this, they invited for breakfast several people who might know something about the book piracy business and spoke to them. To cut a long story short, leaving out all the explosions of indignation that greeted Malhotra's general remarks on piracy, what was made at the post-breakfast meeting was an appeal: &quot;Please tell anyone you know who might be interested in pirating the book that every cent of the royalties from A Thousand Suns is going to the City of Joy Foundation that helps the destitute in Calcutta and offers medical help to the ten lakh dwellers in the unmapped islands of the Sundarbans&quot;. And not a single pirated edition ever appeared after the guests promised to get the message across. A second ambulance boat for the Sundarbans was, thus, what Lapierre was able to take a bow about. </font></p><p><font size="3"> On another occasion, when Malhotra arrived in Paris, the driver of the taxi he hailed told him in effect to load his baggage in the vehicle himself. On his next trip, there was Lapierre waiting for him and a besotted taxi-driver rushing to grab Malhotra's baggage and store it. On the drive into town, Lapierre's conversation appeared to be a continuation of a conversation about the City of Joy Foundation he had had with the cabbie on the way in, only now it became a three-way one. In no time they were at Malhotra's hotel and as Lapierre reached for his wallet to settle the fare, the driver said, &quot;Non, Non&quot; and handed over 100 francs &quot;pour Calcutta&quot;. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Malhotra's storytelling having delineated Lapierre the philanthropist, it was the author's turn. And the focus I thought he would close-up on instead gradually enlarged into a strident cry for Bhopal. &quot;We must never forget,&quot; he thundered in manner reminiscent of MacArthur promising to return to the Philippines. But what is it we must not forget? The dead and the ailing of Bhopal? The arrogance of technology? Or what caused Bhopal? The last, I thought, was the most important lesson, the fact that what was one of the most technically superior plants in the world was allowed to become a poorly maintained one manned by personnel not of the calibre of those who had got it on stream. This was because, once it was found to have been built too big for India and was proving to be a white elephant, cutting costs became the name of the game. And that included the reduction of the necessary refrigeration, less frequent maintenance and less-than- quality replacement or workmanship or technical personnel. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Lapierre, however, preferred to fast forward from this attitudinal tragedy and create an emotional response to the uncared for victims of Bhopal. He might have succeeded too, if he hadn't let an innocent question get the better of his sympathetic understanding or added an hour-long film that made you say there's only so much emotion you can stand of a late evening. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The question that irked Lapierre was from a young woman wondering what was wrong with a plan to raze the Carbide factory and build on its site a recreation facility. An incensed Lapierre was a bit hard on someone who to him might have sounded insensitive, but he lost sight of possible cultural differences and how different people look at memorialising the past. To Lapierre, the only memorial to Bhopal needs must be that gigantic factory rusting midst overgrowth, reminding everyone who visits to &quot;Never forget Bhopal&quot;. But a project in its place whose profits would go to the victims of Bhopal? Never. Hopefully, then, his book will find the money that is needed, year in, year out. </font></p><p><font size="3"> An American tragedy </font></p><p><font size="3"> Coincidentally, Dominique Lapierre who had with Larry Collins written The Fifth Horseman which narrated the story of a New York threatened by an atom bomb strike by terrorists was in town when the horror of New York was unfolding on our screens. Only a few days earlier I had seen the film Siege on TV which featured five terrorist cells striking in New York one by one and ending on a note that might well be interpreted as what ye sow, ye shall reap. Then there have been the forecasts of Raman's Astrological Magazine last January. And before that Nostradamus &amp;151; though all recent translations on the Web do not cite any of the half a dozen published books as a source, making you wonder. </font></p><p><font size="3"> But never mind books, films and astrology, what is clear is that there were enough straws in the wind &amp;151; even in intelligence circles &amp;151; to consider an attack on American lives and property in the U.S. a very real possibility. Especially after the earlier World Trade Centre attack, Oklahoma, and the strikes at embassies in Africa. All right, the Americans after each strike soon forget, become complacent and put the comfort of each American first. But how do you explain the lack of response to aircraft that suddenly vanish from their regular flight-paths? As in the case of Bhopal, almost everyone appears to be letting the tragedy and thoughts of revenge drown such questions as HOW it happened and WHY it was not stopped if it could have been. These questions struck me on seeing a brilliant graphic in this paper's sister publication Business Line. Nothing brought home to me more tellingly the issues raised by these questions as this graphic more cogently presented than anything else I'd seen in the several Indian and foreign publications I skim every day or on the small screen. </font></p><p><font size="3"> This record of the `Flightpath to Disaster&quot; recorded clearly the departure times and crash times of the four planes in a manner that makes questions inevitable. The two flights that hit the WTC took off at 7-58 a.m. and 8-00 a.m. and crashed 9-03 a.m. and 8- 48 a.m. respectively. The plane that hit the Pentagon took off at 8-21 a.m. and crashed at 9-45 a.m. And the one that crashed near Pittsburgh took off at 8-43 a.m. and crashed at 10-10 a.m. They all took off within 45 minutes of each other, but BEFORE the first one crashed, making the closing down of airports NOT a realistic possibility, even if the first two planes had gone rogue during the first few minutes of that space of time. But what is intriguing is that the Pentagon was hit about 45 minutes AFTER the twin strikes on the WTC and the fourth plane crashing about 70 minutes after the first crashes. Surely with a 45-70 minute time gap, there should have been enough time for military interceptors to buzz planes 3 and 4? Did they in fact do so, fail and have their failure kept secret? Or was there just no response, or a tardy one, despite time being available? </font></p><p><font size="3"> Dominique Lapierre might well have the subject of his next book all laid out for him. And maybe we'll have the answers to those questions three years down the line &amp;151; which is about the time it seems to take him to thoroughly research his subject, write the book and have it published. </font></p><p><font size="3"> A Yank at Chepauk </font></p><p><font size="3"> What is the oldest international cricket match in the world, was a question at a recent quiz in Madras and the answer, the U.S.A. vs. Canada, and NOT English vs. Australia, surprised most people. A few days later I was again reading of the American cricketing connection when it was reported that the Compton Cricket Club of Los Angeles, popularly called the Compton Homies and comprising youth from the streets and gangs of that city, had become the first American team to play at Lord's, cricket's home. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Both items reminded me of the Yank who played at Chepauk and who was rated by that respected doyen of cricketers, S. K. Gurunathan, as one of Madras's five cricketers of the 1943-44 season. The American, Frederic Fales Richardson, also found a place in an all-time Madras Cricket Club XI and as a reserve in an all-time Madras XI compiled in 1998 for the MCC's 150th anniversary. Rated as perhaps the most brilliant fielder to have played for Madras, particularly at cover point, and as an &quot;enterprising batsman with stylish offside play&quot;, Richardson learnt his cricket in England, where he arrived aged 2 in 1920. He played three years for Westminster School, captaining the team in his last two years, 1935 and 1936, when he also played for that venerable public school's soccer team. </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> After University days spent at Princeton, he arrived in Calcutta in 1941 to work with Shell but distinguished himself there more on the football field than on the cricket field. But when Richardson arrived in Madras in 1943, C. P. Johnstone, his boss and that immortal Madras cricketer and captain, rushed him into the Madras team for the match against Mysore and all those who scrambled to their seats from the bar crying &quot;Let's see the Yank play&quot; stayed to cheer his batting. And those cheers &amp;151; and his fielding &amp;151; ensured he became a fixture in the Madras team. A stock left-arm bowler, he was put on as a change bowler in the Madras-Holkar semi-final at Chepauk, and had well set C. K. Nayudu and Denis Compton fumbling and scratching, unsettling them so much that Rangachari soon had their wickets. Of this left-handed all-rounder, who played in only five Ranji Trophy matches before he left Madras, it was said, when he left, &quot;He would be chosen every time for any team in India if only for his magnificent fielding&quot;. </font></p><p><font size="3"> S.
