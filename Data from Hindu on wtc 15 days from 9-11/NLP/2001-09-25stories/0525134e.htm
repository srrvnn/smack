        <!-- Date: 25-09-2001 :: Pg: 12 :: Col: e --> </font></p><p><font size="3"> By Kesava Menon </font></p><p><font size="3"> MANAMA (Bahrain) SEPT. 24. As India participates in the task of building a concert of nations that will tackle global terrorism it is bound to come against some asymmetries between the approaches that will be taken by its West Asian partners. </font></p><p><font size="3"> This task will be all the more complicated since each of these partners is trying to strike differing equations with the U.S. administration, the leader in this fight. India's attempts to deal with Iran and Israel simultaneously might well prove to be the most delicate of tasks. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Ironically, of the nations mentioned above, Iran might have the perception that is most closely aligned with that of the U.S. in terms of the definition of who the fight is against. The Shia- dominated Iran sees the Sunni-based global terrorism represented by the Taliban and al-Qaeda as the well-defined menace before it. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Like the U.S., Iran has reason to see the spread of global terrorism as the greatest threat. Iran has been coping with the threats from exiled dissident groups. But, it does not agree with the U.S. view that the groups fighting Israel are terrorist organisations. </font></p><p><font size="3"> While Israel acknowledges that the al-Qaeda brand of terrorism is a menace, its primary concern is with the groups that are currently engaged in suicide bombings and other forms of terrorism. These groups have the specific objective of driving Israel out of the Arab territories it occupies and are not interested in the random havoc of the sort that al-Qaeda seeks to let loose. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The Lebanese Hezbollah has joined the Hamas in distinguishing the nature of its activities and its objectives from groups such as al-Qaeda. While the U.S. does agree with Israel that the Hezbollah, the Hamas and the Islamic Jehad are terrorist groups, it has also been pressing Israel to address the political causes underlying these movements. India too wants the same from Israel, while Iran might not accept Israel even if these political issues are resolved. </font></p><p><font size="3"> India is in a unique position of having to contend with both variants of terrorism. The Hizbul Mujahideen, manned by Kashmiris, at least has an understandable cause while the Pakistan-sponsored and manned outfits such as the Lashkar-e-Taiba are akin to the al-Qaeda variant of terrorist organisations. After all, these Pakistan-based outfits have sent fighters to help the Taliban, the Chechens and into other parts of Central Asia. While Israel has no problem viewing both the Hizbul and the Lashkar variety through the Indian eyes, Iran and the U.S. do want India to address the political issues in Kashmir. </font></p><p><font size="3"> There is one aspect on which India, Israel and Iran can agree and it is a proposition that can gain wider support. All the three would agree that Pakistan's Inter Services Intelligence has been the master-refiner of the global jehad format of indoctrinating the youth, training and asking them to wreak havoc in the name of an ``Islamic'' cause. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Mindful of the fact that Washington currently needs Islamabad in its confrontation with the Taliban and Mr. Osama bin Laden, these three countries need not work for the objective of putting Pakistan on the mat. But the three countries and the U.S. do have an interest in seeing that the indoctrination/training/operation format is definitively wound down. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Israel has undoubted clout in Washington. If the current overtures that have been launched through the good offices of the U.K. meet with success, Iran's importance in the U.S. schemes can only increase. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The Arab States, Russia and perhaps even China will share the view that the global jehad format has to be eradicated irrespective of which agency, private or governmental, is running it. The ways of managing the partnerships will, however, be important. </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font>
