International | Previous UNHCR, Pak.agreement on screening of Afghans By B. Muralidhar Reddy ISLAMABAD, AUG. 2 The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the Pakistan Government today signed a landmark agreement which will establish a joint screening process for Afghans who have fled to Pakistan to escape the drought and conflict in their homeland. The pact was signed hours before the visiting United States Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia, Ms. Christina Rocca, met the Taliban Ambassador in Pakistan, Mullah Abdul Salem Zaeef, and exchanged views on the latest Afghanistan situation. Though details of the interaction were not immediately available, it is believed that Ms. Rocca reiterated her country's concerns over the Saudi terrorist, Osama bin Laden, and charges of the Taliban's `export of terrorism' to its neighbours. The meeting is considered yet another U.S. attempt to persuade the Afghanistan regime to heed to the counsel from the rest of the world and hand over Osama for `fair trail' on a number of charges against him. Recently, the U.S. Government has been sending out signals that it has not `abandoned' the people of Afghanistan after the collapse of the Soviet Union. This was the main theme of Ms. Rocca's visit to the largest Afghan refugee camp outside Peshawar on Wednesday. She told correspondents that the Bush administration has approved a $ 6.2- million assistance programme for Afghans besides the already sanctioned $ 1.32-million aid for the current year. The agreement would go a long way in easing ties as the continuing influx of Afghan refugees into Pakistan has been a major bone of contention between the military Government and the UNHCR in recent months. According to the agreement, among other things, Afghans found to need protection and assistance would be allowed to temporarily stay in Pakistan.
