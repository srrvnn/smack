National | Previous | Next Fresh evidence of Osama funding J&K militants NEW DELHI, AUG. 19. Disapproving Pakistan's claims that a `freedom struggle' is going on in Jammu and Kashmir, Intelligence agencies here have unearthed fresh evidence of the Afghan-based international terrorist mastermind, Osama bin Laden's direct funding of militant activity in the State. ``Osama has targeted his efforts and resources to fight India and certain other countries such as the United States, Israel, Russia and those based in Europe which are perceived by him to be a direct threat to Islam,'' top Intelligence officials told UNI. The sources said Intelligence inputs suggested that Osama motivated thousands of Afghan veterans to join Islamic groups in Asia and Africa, giving a boost to the domestic and global plan of these outfits.. - UNI, PTI
