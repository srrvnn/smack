Front Page | Previous | Next Many Indians still missing NEW YORK, SEPT. 13. More than 250 Indians are among those feared killed, injured or missing following the terrorists attacks on the World Trade Center, where a large number of Indians worked. The Indian Consul-General, Mr. Shashi Tripathi, said 37 Indians are being treated in various hospitals. But some community leaders put the figure of injured at between 60 and 100. The Consulate frequently sends out its representatives to hospitals to check the lists of injured to locate Indians. As anger against Arabs mounted in the U.S. with reports linking Osama bin Laden to the terror attacks and television images showing Palestinian celebrations after the attacks, Mr. Tripathi advised Indians to be more careful during the next few days. The fear is that anyone looking like an Arab might become a target of some groups. He said Indian women could wear bindi to distinguish themselves and men could carry some identification which could be used in times of need. One person has been arrested for a mob attack on a Gurdwara at Richmond Hill during which rubber bullets were fired. The arrest was made when the mob came for the second attack. - PTI
