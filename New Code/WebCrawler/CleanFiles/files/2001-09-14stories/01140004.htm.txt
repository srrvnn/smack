Front Page | Previous | Next Action against Afghanistan soon? By B. Muralidhar Reddy ISLAMABAD, SEPT. 13. The city is abuzz with speculation that an attack by the U.S. on Afghanistan is imminent in the wake of the terrorist strikes. Reports in the U.S. pointing to the involvement of the Saudi billionaire, Osama bin Laden (currently in Afghanistan), and the decision of the United Nations and Western NGOs to withdraw their workers from Afghanistan seem to have convinced diplomatic and political observers about possible U.S. strikes. A large media contingent has descended on Islamabad in anticipation of big action in the coming days. It is believed that missions of many NATO countries are ready with contingency plans to move their staff out of Pakistan. According to sources, diplomatic staff of many Western countries had approached Pakistan for visas. There is speculation that some other embassies were ``thinning down'' their presence in Islamabad. American and British schools have stepped up security. ``We have practiced our movement to the safe haven on the campus and were able to secure all children and teachers in seven minutes,'' said the International School, run by Americans, in a circular to parents.
