Front Page | Previous | Next Osama moves into new hideout KABUL, SEPT. 13. Osama bin Laden moved to a new hiding place within minutes of the terrorist onslaught in the U.S., refusing to tell anyone where he was going or where he had been when the attacks occurred, sources in Pakistan's intelligence service said on Thursday. The sources in Pakistan spoke on condition of anonymity. Pakistan is one of only three countries that recognise Afghanistan's Taliban Government, and is considered to have good intelligence on Islamic militants operating here. A U.S. official, also speaking anonymously, confirmed the Pakistani report. Bin Laden was last seen in public in February, at his son's wedding in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar. - AP
