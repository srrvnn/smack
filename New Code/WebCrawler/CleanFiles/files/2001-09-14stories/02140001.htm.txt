National | Next Enough evidence against Osama: BJP By Our Special Correspondent JODHPUR, SEPT. 13. The Bharatiya Janata Party thinks that there is enough evidence against the international terrorist, Osama bin Laden, for the U.S. to act against him for the recent terrorist attacks in that country. ``I am surprised at the statement of the Afghanistan Government defending Osama bin Laden,'' the BJP president, Mr. K. Jana Krishnamurti, said here today. The impatience of the national BJP leadership with U.S. ``inaction'' was evident from the utterances made during the two- day meeting of the party office-bearers here. ``It is a challenge to human civilisation. The thinking people all over the world should come together to condemn the attacks and to evolve a system in the world whereby no other country faces such a situation in future,'' Mr. Krishnamurti noted. The general secretary of the BJP, Mr. Narendra Modi, had asserted the previous day that the U.S. should seek information on the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden from Gen. Pervez Musharraf going by the latter's observations in Agra recently supporting the cause of Palestine. The BJP president feared that as many as 10-15 per cent of the victims in the attacks on the World Trade Center in the U.S. could be Indians.
