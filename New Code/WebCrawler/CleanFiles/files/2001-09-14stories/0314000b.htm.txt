International | Previous | Next Texas mosque attacked DALLAS, SEPT. 13. A firebomb was hurled at a mosque and Islamic school in Texas, a day after windows were shot out at a similar Islamic centre near Dallas, police said today. Damage was minor at the Islamic Society of Denton after the homemade firebomb burst against a front window late yesterday, police in the city, 64 km north of Dallas, said. ``It was a Molotov cocktail made out of a beer bottle,'' said police duty officer Wanda Rollans. Mosque officials blamed the attack on misplaced anger against Muslims after Tuesday's terror attacks in New York and Washington, linked by a mounting pile of evidence to an Arab connection and possibly Saudi-born dissident Osama bin-Laden. ``The people here are angry, scared, frustrated, all of that,'' said Ahmed al-Arafi of the Denton centre. About 150 Muslims attend services at the centre, the only mosque in Denton, he said. The FBI and agents of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms were helping with the investigation, Denton police said. - Reuters
