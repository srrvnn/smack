International | Previous | Next Musharraf convenes meeting By B. Muralidhar Reddy ISLAMABAD, SEPT. 13. The Pakistan military ruler and President, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, has convened a meeting of the top brass of the military tomorrow to discuss the situation arising out of the terrorist attacks in the U.S. The outcome of the meeting would be of great significance in the wake of the U.S. seeking Pakistan's co-operation to bring the culprits behind the attacks to book. The U.S. had been pressing Pakistan for several months to prevail upon the Taliban to hand over the Saudi fugitive, Osama Bin Laden, for trial on alleged charges against him. The stock response of the Musharraf Government was that the U.S. should directly talk to the militia. However, with the latest developments the equations could change and there is no doubt that the military Government is under tremendous pressure to choose between the Taliban and the rest of the world. Earlier in the day, Gen. Musharraf told the newly-appointed U.S. Ambassador, Ms. Wendy Chamberlin, that Pakistan was opposed to terrorism everywhere and would not hesitate to join in any effort to eliminate the `evil'.
