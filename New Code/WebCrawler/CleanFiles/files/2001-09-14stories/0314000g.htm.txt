International | Previous | Next Duncan Smith to lead Tories LONDON, SEPT. 13. The Opposition Conservative Party chose hard- liner, Mr. Iain Duncan Smith, as its new leader on Thursday, marking a turn to the right and rejecting warnings from those who said his selection would doom the Tories to political irrelevance. In a two-man race decided by party members, Mr. Smith handily beat veteran officeholder, mr. Kenneth Clarke, with 155,933 votes or 61 per cent to Kenneth Clarke's 100,864. Under Britain's Parliamentary system, Mr. Smith would become Prime Minister if the Conservatives win the next national election, probably at least four years off. ``The party I want to lead will be an effective opposition to this Government. It will campaign on the issues that matter to people, the things that affect them most in their daily lives .... the state of their public services, health, welfare, education and the environment,'' Mr. Smith said after the vote was announced. His staunch opposition to greater British involvement in the European Union - and a vow never to join the continent's single currency - seemed to appeal to Tories worried by Mr. Clarke's pro-European stance. Mr. Smith, 47, had the backing of the former Prime Minister, Ms. Margaret Thatcher. But some prominent Tories, including Ms. Thatcher's successor, Mr. John Major, said Mr. Clarke's more moderate politics and the respect he commands among many Britons would have given the battered party a better chance of regaining power. - AP
