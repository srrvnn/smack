Front Page | Previous | Next Indian embassy concerned about attacks on Indians By Sridhar Krishnaswami WASHINGTON, SEPT. 14. Indian missions in this country - the Consulate in New York and the Embassy in Washington - are doing their best to help the community in the aftermath of the tragedy that struck New York and Washington on Tuesday. The Indian Ambassador, Mr. Lalit Mansingh, in a meeting with mediapersons, listed the services that had been provided, including the hotlines used by relatives and well- wishers. Mr. Mansingh said the Embassy and the Consulate had taken seriously reports of attack and harassment of Indians. Their complaints to the authorities had found swift response as well - as for instance, in calls to the New York Mayor, Mr. Rudolph Giuliani. There have been cases of harassment of people of Indian origin, especially Sikhs, and officials have requested police protection at the gurudwara in New York. The authorities had apprehended one person here, the Ambassador pointed out. What has been pointed out is that of an estimated 40,000 persons supposed to be working at the time of the tragedy, 14,000 had been evacuated and the number of people trapped was between 5,000 and 10,000, including a certain percentage of Indians.
