        <!-- Date: 12-09-2001 :: Pg: 06 :: Col: d --> </font></p><p><font size="3"> By Our Special Correspondent </font></p><p><font size="3"> HYDERABAD, SEPT. 11. The senior BJP leader and Medak MP, Mr. A. Narendra, has stepped up his defiance against the party by refusing to call off the proposed convention of Telangana protagonists here on September 19 to mark the launch of a separate forum to be headed by him. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Mr. Narendra announced his resignation from the post of vice- president of the State unit but declared that he would continue as its active member. He, however, ruled out his resignation as MP on the ground that ``I was elected by the voters of Medak and answerable to only them.'' </font></p><p><font size="3"> The State unit of the party, reacting sharply to his decision to organise the convention, described it as an anti- party activity warranting disciplinary action and asked him to publicly disown the move. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Addressing a press conference on Tuesday, he argued that his association with the BJP did not come in the way organising a forum in pursuit of the cause of Telangana, ``as the exercise is meant to protect the party cadre.'' Moreover, his effort to mobilise support for the Telangana State was in tune with the BJP resolution at its Kakinada State executive, he contended. </font></p><p><font size="3"> He parried questions on the possibility of his expulsion from the party for defying the party line. ``Let them do it. I will react then.'' </font></p><p><font size="3"> In his reply to a letter received from the party seeking his explanation on the proposed convention, Mr. Narendra said there was no question of reconsidering his decision ``which has the support of thousands of party workers and leaders from the region.'' </font></p><p><font size="3"> In the letter addressed to BJP State unit president, Mr. C. Ramachandra Reddy, Mr. Narendra conveyed his decision to quit the party post and urged him to accept the same. The letter seeking his explanation on the mobilisation of people for the September 19 convention was sent by the BJP State general secretary, Mr. P. Venugopal Reddy. The MP was asked to sent his reply by 5 p.m. on Tuesday. </font></p><p><font size="3"> In his reply, Mr. Narendra questioned the party's support to the TDP in the crucial Siddipet Assembly byelection,`` a decision on which was taken without a discussion or consultation with the presidents and general secretaries of the district units in Telangana.'' He said as vice-president of the State unit, he was also unaware of the decision to support the TDP. </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> Mr. Narendra said his appeal to the voters of Siddipet would be to support the forces that would help the cause of Telangana. He dubbed the Congress political opportunist and the TDP as anti- Telangana. ``It is obvious that our support is for the Telangana Rastra Samithi in the Siddipet bypoll,'' he added in reply to a question. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The BJP MP said the main idea in forming the forum was to protect the party in Telangana which was weakened by desertions to the TRS. He indicated that many like-minded political elements like the former Congress Minister, Mr.D.K. Samarasimha Reddy (who himself toyed with the idea of floating a forum), would join the convention. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The BJP MP said that two legislators - Dr. R. Ravindranath Reddy, (Alampur) and Mr. K. Ramakrishna Reddy (Peddapalli) - besides the former MP, Mr. C. Jana Reddy and Mr. L. Bhupathi, State disciplinary action committee chairman, were actively involved in the preparation for the convention. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Charge against Naidu </font></p><p><font size="3"> Mr. Narendra alleged that the TDP president and Chief Minister, Mr. N. Chandrababu Naidu, was using the alliance with the BJP to see that the latter does not emerge as a third force in the State. ``He was keen on protecting his position or the status of Opposition, leaving no space for the BJP. The alliance is therefore not in our interests.'' </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font>
