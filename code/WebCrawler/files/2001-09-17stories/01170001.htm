      <!-- story begins --> <h3> <font color="blue"> Pak. wants Taliban to hand over Osama </font> </h3> <p> <font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> 
        <!-- Date: 17-09-2001 :: Pg: 01 :: Col: b --> </font></p><p><font size="3"> By B. Muralidhar Reddy </font></p><p><font size="3"> ISLAMABAD, SEPT. 16. An official delegation of the Pakistan military Government is leaving for Kandahar tomorrow for a meeting with the Taliban chief, Mullah Mohammad Omar, to persuade him to hand over the fugitive Saudi billionaire, Osama bin Laden, to avoid possible retaliation from the United States. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The decision to send an official delegation to prevail upon Mullah Omar was taken by the Government after the President, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, held a series of meetings. He consulted Editors, representatives of political parties and the `ulema' (religious leadership) amidst reports of unease within society over the prospect of the Government providing the facilities demanded by the U.S. to launch strikes against the Taliban Government. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The efforts of the military Government came even as Mullah Omar reportedly issued a new `fatwa' for jehad against the U.S. for wanting to unjustly target the Muslim world. Reports from Afghanistan said that the Taliban chief had called an emergency meeting of senior clerics to discuss the situation. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Extradition to Europe? </font></p><p><font size="3"> Indications are that the delegation would try to persuade Mullah Omar to extradite Osama to an European country in the larger interests of the people of Afghanistan and Pakistan and to avoid bloodshed in the region in the event of retaliation by the U.S. It is difficult to guess as to how successful the delegation would be given the adamant posture of the Taliban chief and the threatening noises by the regime. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The Taliban had conducted negotiations with the U.S. - prior to the latest attacks - on Osama's extradition. It had suggested three specific proposals, involving the trial of Osama by a `shariat court', but they were not acceptable to the U.S. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The nature of the challenge faced by Gen. Musharraf was evident from his speech to the religious leaders he had invited for consultations. He was at pains to emphasise that every decision of his Government was directed towards the objective of ``unity, integrity and welfare of the nation''. </font></p><p><font size="3"> He told the `ulema' that he was undertaking the process of consultation to seek the opinion of various sections of society, including the leaders of various schools of thought. It was his firm faith that ``every thing would be alright, if Pakistan is intact. Hence, it is imperative that all should join hands to consolidate the integrity and sovereignty of Pakistan.'' </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> Earlier, in his address to Editors and columnists, Gen. Musharraf assured that he would keep the ``supreme'' national interest uppermost in his mind while taking decisions in the emerging confrontation. ``We are alive to the gravity of the situation and know that in the lives of nations such situations do arise and require taking important decisions.'' </font></p><p><font size="3"> Reports indicated that in the coming days, Gen. Musharraf could travel to China and Saudi Arabia to appraise the governments there about the situation arising out the strikes on the U.S. cities and the decision of his regime to help bring to book those responsible. </font></p><p><font size="3"> `Keep India out' </font></p><p><font size="3"> Meanwhile, CNN reported that the Musharraf Government was doing some tough bargaining with the Bush administration in return for its unqualified support for operations against the Taliban. Some conditions, reportedly put forth by Pakistan, include U.S. role in resolution of the Kashmir dispute, a financial package to bail out the country from its present economic crisis and a guarantee to keep India and Israel out of any possible operation against the Taliban. </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font>
