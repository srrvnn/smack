        <!-- Date: 18-09-2001 :: Pg: 11 :: Col: f --> </font></p><p><font size="3"> By Neena Vyas </font></p><p><font size="3"> NEW DELHI, SEPT. 17. Even as the Bharatiya Janata Party is optimistic that the recent focus on `Islamic' terrorism will have an adverse fallout on its political opponents in Uttar Pradesh who have a large Muslim support base, the Chief Minister, Mr. Rajnath Singh, has said he would wish to make the performance of his Government the main issue in the coming assembly polls. </font></p><p><font size="3"> At a day-long meeting of the Bharatiya Janata Party's central leaders and the State leadership, the political scenario in U.P. was discussed region-by-region on the basis of the recent tour by central and State leaders of all the 403 Assembly segments. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The party president, Mr. Jana Krishnamurthi, chaired the meeting and in the evening met the Prime Minister to brief him. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Although the recent terrorist attacks on the United States and the global media focus on the use of Islam by terrorists did come up, the matter was not discussed. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Nevertheless, party leaders have indicated that they think the issue will have an adverse impact on the BJP's two major rivals, the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party which have a sizeable support among Muslims. </font></p><p><font size="3"> At present, BJP leaders are not willing to state on record that they would raise terrorism as an election issue, but it seems the party is certainly keeping its options open. </font></p><p><font size="3"> ``Whether terrorism becomes an issue or not, it will affect people's thinking,'' Mr. Rajnath Singh said after the meeting. </font></p><p><font size="3"> His Government had already issued an ordinance on the new reservation policy demarcating separate quotas for the most backward castes and the most oppressed among the dalits. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Advertisements had been placed that he would not dissolve the Assembly before young men start getting jobs under the new policy. ``I want to go to the polls on the basis of my performance, not on the basis of some electoral strategy,'' he added. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The party has decided that it will hold 17 to 18 rallies in different towns of U.P. by November to spread the message of ``social justice'' in relation to the new reservation policy. The entire party machinery is to be put on top gear for these rallies. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Lashing out at the SP MLAs for resigning their Assembly seats to ``run away'' from the ``debate on social justice'' when the ordinance comes up before a special session of the Assembly, he dismissed reports about one of his own MLAs, Mr. Pappu Chaudhry, joining the SP. ``He has been distant from the party for some time.'' </font></p><p><font size="3"> Mr. Sunil Shastri, party general secretary and spokesperson, later said that after the assessment at the meeting, the BJP was confident it would emerge as the number one political party after the elections. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Mr. Rajnath Singh went a step further claiming the BJP would get a majority on its own, the allies would bring in the bonus seats. </font></p><p><font size="3"> A view also emerged at the meeting that there has to be a ``change,'' that the new reservation policy would have to be reflected in representation of the most backward and most oppressed castes in the party organisation as well as in the selection of candidates. </font></p><p><font size="3"> It was also decided that when finalising renomination of sitting MLAs, the ``performance and the popularity'' of the sitting MLAs would be a major factor. </font></p><p><font size="3"> If necessary, a large number of them would be changed, although at present it was too early to put a figure on that. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Besides Mr. Krishnamurthi, Mr. Kushabhau Thakre, Mr. Narendra Modi, Mr. Kailashpati Mishra, Mr. Pyarelal Khandelwal, Mr. Shastri, Mr. Rajnath Singh, Mr. Kalraj Mishra, Mr. Lalji Tandon, Mr. Om Prakash Singh, Mr. Harish Chandra Srivastava, the three organising secretaries, State vice-presidents and general secretaries participated in the deliberations. </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font>
