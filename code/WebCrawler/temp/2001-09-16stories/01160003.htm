        <!-- Date: 16-09-2001 :: Pg: 01 :: Col: b --> </font></p><p><font size="3"> By B. Muralidhar Reddy </font></p><p><font size="3"> ISLAMABAD, SEPT. 15. Giving in to the demands of the United States, the military establishment here today agreed to extend full support to the international community in bringing to book the ``perpetrators, organisers and sponsors'' of the terrorist strikes on the American cities. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Islamabad took a decision to this effect after a combined meeting of the National Security Council (NSC) and the Federal Cabinet, presided over by the Pakistan President, Gen. Pervez Musharraf. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The Foreign Minister, Mr. Abdul Sattar, who addressed a crowded press conference after the meeting, was at his diplomatic best and refused to go into the specifics of the U.S. ``wish list''. He argued that he was not in a position to spell out the details and could only talk in general terms. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Among the demands made by the Bush administration include consent for use of Pakistan's soil/airspace if the U.S. were to decide to launch strikes against Afghanistan, closure of border and fuel supplies to Afghanistan and sharing of all information about the operations of Osama bin Laden. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Mr. Sattar declined to answer a question on the threat held out by Taliban to declare war against any neighbour supporting the U.S. He insisted that Afghanistan was a good friend and Pakistan would act in conformity with its policy of support to the well- being of its people. </font></p><p><font size="3"> He said Pakistan was looking forward to holding talks with the Taliban regime on the ``emergency situation''. He maintained that Pakistan did not expect to participate in any military action outside its borders. ``That question does not arise. We have not been asked by anyone to take part in an international campaign.'' </font></p><p><font size="3"> The military Government appears to be gearing up to prepare the nation for the likely strikes against Afghanistan. It has embarked on a course to take all influential players in the country, including the `ulema' (religious leadership), into confidence before making public the facilities it has decided to grant to the U.S. Gen. Musharraf is expected to meet representatives of political parties and also opinion-makers to appraise them of the ``grave international situation and its implications for Pakistan's security''. The objective is to mollify the agitated sections about the prospects of the country's soil being used by foreign forces. </font></p><p><font size="3"> It is difficult at this juncture to guess as to how the political, religious and militant outfits will react to the Government decision. They have cautioned against allowing Pakistani soil to be used for strikes against another country. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Mr. Sattar's press conference took place before the U.S. President, Mr. George Bush, named Osama as the prime suspect. So his stock reply to questions was that to the best of his knowledge the U.S. had not yet come to any conclusion on the group involved in the dastardly acts. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The Foreign Minister was at pains to emphasise that in the course of the four-hour long deliberations the NSC and the Cabinet decided to extend full support to the international community in combating terrorism. ``Consistent with Pakistan's policy of support for the decisions of the Security Council, the Government will discharge its responsibilities under international law,'' he said. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The refrain of Mr. Sattar was that as a responsible member of the United Nations, Pakistan would honour the resolutions adopted by the U.N. General Assembly and the Security Council on the terrorist attacks. The resolutions called for international cooperation to bring to justice the perpetrators, organisers and sponsors of the terrorist acts. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The Minister said Gen. Musharraf briefed the meeting on the actions taken by the Government in the ``emergency situation'' and on its contacts with the U.S. Government. Pakistan has also been in touch with the People's Republic of China, Saudi Arabia and other friendly countries. </font></p><p><font size="3"> He disclosed that a special envoy of the Saudi Government was in Islamabad on Friday to discuss the emerging situation. Besides, Gen. Musharraf met the Chinese Ambassador in Pakistan earlier in the day. </font></p><p><font size="3"> To a question on the decision of the Government to close the Islamabad international airport on Friday for a few hours, he said the landing of a foreign aircraft without permission necessitated it. The Government had also received a security threat and the airport was re-opened after necessary precautions. </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font>
