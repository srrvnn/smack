        <!-- Date: 16-09-2001 :: Pg: 23 :: Col: e --> </font></p><p><font size="3"> THIS column is being written less than 20 hours after America came under attack, it will appear four days after it is written. In the interim, the tenor of the coverage will change, the suspected villain of the piece may change, and there is no way of knowing if worse is to come. So let me turn instead to the dilemmas terrorism poses for media coverage. </font></p><p><font size="3"> As we were watching the Hollywood-like footage of the crumbling of the World Trade Centre for the umpteenth time, my daughter suddenly said apropos of nothing, &quot;my classmates do not like Muslims&quot;. The statement jolted us before one recognised its sub- text: for the past few hours the enormity of the attack on the United States was being projected by the TV channels as the villainy of Islam. Within the first hours, Osama bin Laden was described as the prime suspect, and he is seldom described without Islam being appended to his identity. </font></p><p><font size="3"> And this is only the latest example. Each time there is an incident of terrorism in Kashmir, in the U.S., in Mumbai - anywhere, the perpetrators are identified as Muslims without sufficient repetition of the context. In a school whose students are overwhelmingly from upper middle class Punjabi Hindu families, it is easy to acquire and bandy about a breezy prejudice against an entire community. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The media does play a role in this. On Tuesday, millions of children and adults around the world watched the instantaneous destruction of what could be at least 20,000 lives. And several times in a space of a few hours they were shown people dancing, celebrating and making V-for-victory signs in the Arab quarters of Jerusalem. On one hand you had TV anchors groping for adjectives to encompass the enormity of what had happened - an attack to rival Pearl Harbour, the worst terrorist attack in the history of mankind, a crime against civilisation - and on the other you had these scenes of celebration presented with little or no contextualisation. What did they tell the world about the gross insensitivity of ordinary Arabs and Palestinians? What did they neglect to tell the world about the history of the U.S. role in that region? </font></p><p><font size="3"> On the CNN message board the anger comes tumbling out, some communities are being described as animals, demands to crush Palestinians are being voiced. And then there is this message, a response to an earlier one: Jim, i am a fellow NZer of Palestinian origin. I urge u to look at the full picture here and not just what u see on CNN. Is it a tragedy? OFCOURSE, but ask ourself what drove these ppl to do such a despicable thing. For every innocent American that died yesterday, 1000 Arabs have met with the same fate over the years, some of them, i suspect, directly related to the &quot;crazy&quot; highjackers. Why? because of the U.S.'s oil thirsty foreign policy. Oh, and before u all jump to any conclusions, i am, and have always been, Christian. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The problem of media in relation to the Palestinian problem runs quite deep. Some telling figures are to be found from the study of an Israeli researcher reported in November 2000. He surveyed the foreign correspondents who have been covering the conflict. Some 300 foreign news organisations are represented in Israel, many more than in any other place in the Middle East. The second is Egypt - with only 120. Two-thirds of these come from Western Europe and North America, and English-language news represents the overwhelming majority of reporting from the West Bank and Gaza Strip available internationally. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The study's findings make it clear why the Israeli viewpoint dominates the international press. The vast majority of the correspondents report from Israel about news from the Palestinian Authority as well, and about the conflict in general. A fairly large proportion among them are Jewish, most have lived in Israel for many years (almost 10 years is the average), and some are married to Israeli women. Some are veteran Israeli journalists who report from Israel to the foreign media on a permanent basis. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The Western background of most of the journalists makes it easier for them to connect with the Israeli mentality than that of the Palestinians. About 91 per cent defined their knowledge of Israel as &quot;good&quot;, as opposed to only 41 per cent who said they thought their knowledge of Arab countries was on a good level, and 35 per cent who said it was &quot;medium&quot;. They also know a great deal more about Judaism than about Islam: 57 per cent said they had a &quot;good&quot; level of knowledge of Judaism, as opposed to only 10 per cent for Islam. And their Hebrew is much better than their Arabic: 54 per cent are completely fluent in Hebrew and another 20 per cent have a working knowledge of the language, while only six per cent are fluent in Arabic, while another 42 per cent can &quot;get by&quot; in Arabic. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Most significantly, all but a literal handful of the foreign and Israeli correspondents writing for the English-language news agencies and wire services live in Israeli-controlled parts of the country where a full range of Western-style amenities are readily accessible. News is often produced with only irregular exposure to Palestinian society, without visiting Palestinian areas and, in the worst cases, Palestinians sources are not consulted for their reaction to events before publication. The researcher, as one said before, was an Israeli. (An analysis of a number of other factors which influence news coverage of this conflict is available at http://electronicintifada.net/introduction.html) Does American or international public opinion then get an objective enough picture of the conflict in West Asia that nurtures terrorism? </font></p><p><font size="3"> When the projected villain is Islamic fundamentalism, the Muslim community worldwide, as innocent as the victims of terrorist attacks, ends up bearing the brunt. On the first day of the attacks in the U.S. there were occasional references on television to the disappearance of New York cab drivers who are substantially West Asian in origin. Eight million Muslims in the U.S. would have instantly begun to feel vulnerable. So what can the media do about it? </font></p><p><font size="3"> The Detroit Free Press tried tacking the problem following earlier terrorist attacks. Recognising that attacks on U.S. embassies in Africa and counter-attacks by the U.S. rekindled prejudices against American Arabs and Muslims, and on the eve of the release of &quot;Siege&quot;, the movie featuring bombings by Arabic Muslims in New York, the Free Press organised for its staffers to hear from Detroit-area Muslims. They were invited to come and talk to the newspaper. One complaint voiced was that every time there was a terrorist attack, journalists asked Detroit area Muslims for their opinion. Every time there is violence in Northern Ireland, Muslim community leaders asked, did the media ask local Catholics what they thought? Was the media failing to see a separation between a community and the terrorists belonging to that community? </font></p><p><font size="3"> SEVANTI NINAN </font></p><p><font size="3"> E-mail the writer at sevantininan@vsnl.com </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font>
