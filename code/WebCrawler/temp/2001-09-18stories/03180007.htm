      <!-- story begins --> <h3> <font color="blue"> Pak. media highlights Musharraf's demands </font> </h3> <p> <font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> 
        <!-- Date: 18-09-2001 :: Pg: 12 :: Col: b --> </font></p><p><font size="3"> By B. Muralidhar Reddy </font></p><p><font size="3"> ISLAMABAD, SEPT. 17. The so-called India factor in the confrontation between the Taliban regime and the U.S. is a major concern of the military establishment here which has been asked by the U.S. to play a ``pro-active'' role in tracking down Osama bin Laden, believed to be hiding in Afghanistan. </font></p><p><font size="3"> This is evident from the spate of news reports and commentaries in the Pakistani media about the reported strategy of the Musharraf Government to ensure that India does not gain from the conflict. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Most of the newspapers have reported that the Musharraf Government has presented its own ``wish list'' to the Bush administration as a quid pro quo for its unstinted cooperation in its fight against Osama and the Taliban regime. The American television network, CNN, had also reported about some of the concessions sought by the Musharraf regime. </font></p><p><font size="3"> As per the media reports, a more pro-active role by the U.S. on Kashmir issue and a guarantee of its nuclear facilities dominate the list of demands raised by the Musharraf Government. </font></p><p><font size="3"> No official in the military Government was willing to comment on the veracity of the reports. At this juncture, it is not clear if the Musharraf Government has indeed raised the points with the U.S. or whether they are ``inspired reports for domestic consumption''. A western diplomat, while not ruling out the possibility of the Musharraf regime seeking a package, wondered whether the military Government would have actually sought a pro- active role by the U.S. on Kashmir. </font></p><p><font size="3"> ``There are no free lunches anywhere. The Musharraf Government would certainly expect something in return for its major shift in foreign policy towards the Taliban. However, it is doubtful if the Musharraf Government would have raised the contentious Kashmir issue,'' the diplomat remarked. </font></p><p><font size="3"> ``Pakistan has given its demands to the U.S., including relief from foreign debt, protection of its national security and resolution of Kashmir issue,'' Pakistani English daily, The Nation, has reported quoting informed sources. </font></p><p><font size="3"> It said Pakistan had insisted that it did not prefer a hostile or pro-India Government to replace Taliban regime. ``It is a major concern for us. Pakistan does not want a hostile Government on its western borders,'' it quoted an unnamed official. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The paper said the Musharraf regime had sought an assurance that in the event of action against the Taliban, the coalition forces did not pose any threat to its nuclear installations. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Referring to Pakistan's demand for the resolution of the Kashmir issue, the newspaper quoted an official as saying that ``if Pakistan's demands are met, there is no hurdle in the way to extend all-out co-operation to the U.S. against terrorism''. </font></p><p><font size="3"> In another report from Washington, the paper said Pakistan had agreed to join the U.S.-led action against Afghanistan on the condition that Indian and Israeli forces would not be a part of any military coalition that used Pakistan's soil and facilities. </font></p><p><font size="3"> ``No Israeli or Indian soldier would be allowed in Pakistan and Washington has acceded to this Islamabad's request as justified,'' another English daily, The News said. Pakistan's Ambassador to the U.S., Ms. Maleeha Lodhi, in an interview to the CNN in </font></p><p><font size="3"> Washington, had refused to go into the terms and conditions between Islamabad and the U.S. ``It is not yet time to discuss all such issues now,'' she argued. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Pakistan's Finance Minister, Mr. Shaukat Aziz, is on record that the prospects of radically-improved relations with the U.S. could pay rich financial dividends. Islamabad has been seeking a special package of financial assistance from the international financial institutions. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Reports in the local media, attributed to former diplomats, said they were of the view that Pakistan should, instead of eyeing on economic gains, seriously consider finding ways to come out from the existing threat. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Talking to the Urdu daily, Jang, former Foreign Secretary, Mr. Akram Zaki, has said that Pakistan was in a devastating vortex and before making any opinion it should consult politicians to have a national consensus. He has said that all the Muslims countries should also be consulted to form a ``joint Islamic opinion'' on the prevailing situation. </font></p><p><font size="3"> He told the daily that Pakistan should urge the U.S. to refrain its media from making baseless propaganda against the Islamic world and Muslims. Former diplomat, Mr. Maqbool Ahmad Bhatti, said it was not a war between good and evil. It was an international issue and Pakistan too had been a victim of terrorism. </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font>
