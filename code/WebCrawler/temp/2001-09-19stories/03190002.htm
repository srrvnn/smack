        <!-- Date: 19-09-2001 :: Pg: 16 :: Col: b --> </font></p><p><font size="3"> By Sridhar Krishnaswami </font></p><p><font size="3"> WASHINGTON, SEPT. 18. The Congressional agenda with the Bush administration has suddenly changed; and there is the unmistakable impression that when law makers get ready for their target adjournment in the first week of next month, there will be more agreement than disagreement between Capitol Hill and the White House. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Democratic law makers have come to the conclusion that this is not a time to be looking for fights even with such programmes as the Missile Defence plan; and the defence appropriations of nearly $ 330 billions will be passed without much difficulty. </font></p><p><font size="3"> In a town that never forgets politics, no one wants to pick a fight over the Defence Bill. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Congressional aides are convinced that between now and adjournment - whenever that comes about - law makers will be mostly inclined to side with the administration. </font></p><p><font size="3"> That is the lead in several instances on legislation is going to come from the administration whether it has to do with tightening internal security laws, bailing out the airlines industry or coming up with additional funding for countries that line up behind the United States in the fight against terrorism. Again, this town knows that there is nothing like a free lunch. </font></p><p><font size="3"> In all, the tough talk of the last few days by the President, Mr. George W. Bush, and in the broad consent of the law makers to what is being asked of them, there is also some quiet apprehension on what is taking place. </font></p><p><font size="3"> On a very general level, this has to do with a perception that perhaps rhetoric is getting slightly out of hand; and in an unease in some Capitol Hill quarters that perhaps the administration is actually looking for a blank cheque in its war against terrorism, that is not just in a monetary sense. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Several opinion polls have been doing the rounds in the last few days on how Mr. Bush has been handling the extraordinary crisis. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The unanimous opinion is that he is either doing an excellent or a very good job - nearly 90 per cent of the American people believe this is the case. </font></p><p><font size="3"> And in party wise affiliation, one poll shows that more than 75 per cent of Democrats approve of the manner the President's actions. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The President is getting very high marks, not just for his tough anti-terrorism talk and ``getting'' Osama bin Laden, but also for the manner in which he has been reaching out to the diverse population. Knowing that some communities are being unfairly targeted on account of their religious background or appearance, Mr. Bush has especially been reaching out to the Arab Americans. His visit to the Islamic Centre here on Monday has gone down very well. </font></p><p><font size="3"> But the overall focus is on two directions: economic and strategic. Financial analysts are making the point that the tough talk and rising rhetoric did not help the markets when it re- opened on Monday, the Dow crashing nearly 700 points to an all- time low since 1998. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The attention needs to be a broad-based one involving not just the financial community but the administration and Congress. If the President is toying with the idea of further tax cuts, that will need a broad bipartisan support at this time. It is how this administration is going to get at terrorism in the both short and long term is where the attention and anxiety is. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The anti-terrorism coalition that the President is seeking to build has its share of sceptics from allies in Europe and West Asia. And then there are those who say that Mr. Bush should not lose the initial momentum and go after targets in Afghanistan even as the longer term plan against terrorism is being put in place. </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font>
