        <!-- Date: 19-09-2001 :: Pg: 13 :: Col: e --> </font></p><p><font size="3"> By B. Muralidhar Reddy </font></p><p><font size="3"> ISLAMABAD, SEPT. 18. The first signs of unrest in Pakistan over the prospect of the American retaliatory strikes against the Taliban regime were evident today in the port city of Karachi. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Reports from the city said the police had a tough time controlling a crowd of 5,000-odd activists of religious parties attempting to march towards the U.S. Consulate. The marchers reportedly burnt an effigy of the U.S. President, Mr. George Bush, and shouted slogans such as `Down with America', `America's graveyard, Afghanistan-Pakistan' and `We are Osama, we are Taliban'. </font></p><p><font size="3"> It is a delicate situation for the Musharraf Government though the military is in control. However, if steps are not taken by the Government to take the religious and militant groups on board on its strategy, the situation could prove difficult to handle. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The process of consultations with various sections of society initiated by the Pakistan President, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, last week was aimed at this. But going by the debate within the country on the merits of co-operation with the U.S., it has not helped in achieving a consensus. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The next few days would be important as the Council for Defence of Pakistan and Afghanistan (CDPA), a conglomerate of over 20 Islamic parties in Pakistan, has given a call for a countrywide strike on Friday to protest the proposed U.S. strikes on the Taliban and Osama bin Laden. The CDPA was formed early this year to protest the second round of sanctions imposed by the United Nations against the Taliban in January. Its mandate was to mobilise support within and outside Pakistan in favour of the Taliban, but it was hardly visible in the last few months. </font></p><p><font size="3"> In a resolution adopted at its meeting in Lahore on Monday, the CDPA said, ``The Council considers an attack on Afghanistan as an attack on Pakistan and it would respond positively to the jehad call given by the Afghan Government.'' The meeting was presided over by the Council's chairman, Maulana Samiul Haq, who leads a faction of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam. </font></p><p><font size="3"> It was addressed by among others by the President of Jamat Ulema Islami, Maulana Fazlur Rehman, Leader of Jamaat-i- Islami, Qazi Hussain Ahmad, Lt. Gen. (retd.) K.M. Azhar, Maulana Mohammad Azam Tariq of the Sipah-i-Sihaba Pakistan, Mr. Afaq Ahmad Khan of the MQM (Haqeeqi faction), and the Lashkar-e-Taiba chief, Mohammad Hafeez Saeed. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The Council announced a month-long programme of rallies throughout the country to oppose the Government's support to the U.S., to express solidarity with the people of Afghanistan and to condemn the terrorist attacks in the US and to express solidarity with the victims. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Gen. Musharraf is trying his best to explain the compelling circumstances under which his Government has announced support to the U.S. After his meeting with religious and political leaders, the State-run Pakistan Television ran a series of interviews with some of the leaders in support of the Government approach to the crisis. </font></p><p><font size="3"> In his meeting with the former Prime Minister of Pakistan- occupied Kashmir, Sardar Abdul Qayyum Khan, Gen. Musharraf emphasised that no step would be initiated against the solidarity, sovereignty and security of the country. </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font>
