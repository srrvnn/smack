        <!-- Date: 19-09-2001 :: Pg: 14 :: Col: e --> </font></p><p><font size="3"> By Inder Malhotra </font></p><p><font size="3"> While the Taliban in Kabul wrestles with the excruciating dilemma of whether or not to hand over Osama bin Laden to the United States or a third country, the talk among the capital's chatterati, including some claiming to be close to the ruling establishment, is concentrated on Kashmir. A surprisingly widespread notion, subscribed to by many, is that, as at Agra, so over the issue of supporting the U.S. in its war on terrorism, Gen. Pervez Musharrafs Pakistan has ``upstaged'' this country. </font></p><p><font size="3"> By exploiting his country's geo-strategic location and promising to meet Washington's every demand, the argument runs, Pakistan's military ruler has ``persuaded'' the U.S. to ``de-link'' Kashmir from the burning question of terrorism, and indeed to play an active role to settle this ``core issue''. Categorical American denials of this - among others by the new U.S. Ambassador, Mr. Robert Blackwill, who seems to be a human dynamo, judging by the pace at which he works - have not dispelled the misgiving. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Nor have those holding fast to the idea of an U.S.-Pakistan deal paused to ponder that a Faustian bargain between Washington and Islamabad would tear to shreds the credibility of America's vow to launch a global war on terrorism. </font></p><p><font size="3"> That such a state of affairs persists - despite a radical change in the international situation (after all, Pakistan is no longer America's ``most allied ally,'' while relations between India and the U.S. have improved remarkably) - is a sad commentary on both the most powerful democracy and the most populous one. </font></p><p><font size="3"> To take America's responsibility first, since long before September 11 - ``when the world changed'' - the U.S. has been joining this country in inveighing against terrorism. The two countries even have a joint working group (JWG) against the menace of terrorism about which periodically there is much hype. But over all these years never once has the U.S. used the word terrorism, leave alone the expression cross-border terrorism, about what has been going on in Jammu and Kashmir for more than a decade. ``Violence'' is the standard American description of all the dastardly and diabolical deeds of Pakistan-backed terrorist gangs whom Gen. Musharraf and his minions call ``freedom fighters''. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Arguably the negative impact on the Indian mind of this stance of the U.S. might have been less had New Delhi taken up the matter with Washington publicly and forthrightly. But nothing of the kind has been done. The excuse that private persuasion - wholly ineffectual so far - is better than public pressure does not wash. Even post-September 11, there has been only a gentle hint about this problem in the Prime Minister, Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee's TV address to the nation, nothing more. </font></p><p><font size="3"> This marked failure of the Vajpayee Government gets magnified by its contrary proclivity to be over-generous, sometimes exuberant, in its statements that, in its judgment, are likely to please the White House and enhance the ``paradigm change'' in America's attitude towards this country. The hasty and gushing statement with which the External Affairs Ministry applauded the U.S. President, Mr. George W. Bush's speech announcing the NMD programme was a telling instance in point. Sadly, the underlying style remains unchanged. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Until the time of writing, there has been no U.S. request for any assistance in the planned punitive action against Osama and Afghanistan. Privately, the South Block has been telling the U.S. State Department, sensibly enough, that military strikes on Afghanistan ought to be the ``last resort'' and that a ``large concert of democracies'', including China but excluding Pakistan, should be mobilised before launching ``extensively - prepared'' military strikes. </font></p><p><font size="3"> But before any of this could percolate into the public domain, the media in U.S. and even in this country was full of reports that an over-enthusiastic India had offered the Americans every conceivable help in conducting its military operations, including ``temporary stationing'' of American troops at Indian military bases. How and why did this happen? </font></p><p><font size="3"> However, if the Government is remiss, so are quite a few of its critics whose mindset remains firmly embedded in the Cold War era at its height. That apart, they are not prepared to look at a proposition by the criterion whether it promotes Indian security and supreme interests. Morality and old `mantras' form their touchstone. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Hence, the outcry against any kind of military cooperation with the U.S. and certainly against any U.S. military presence here, however transitory, under any circumstances. Their reason: this would undermine the policy of nonalignment. These innocent souls evidently do not know that American military forces were on Indian soil in 1963 in the aftermath of the brief but brutal border war with China in the high Himalayas. I covered a massive exercise, Operation `Siksha', in which the air forces of India, the U.S., Britain and Australia took part. I also flew in an American C-130 from Delhi to Leh and back. Some U-2 American spy planes flew on their missions from the Jhabua airbase in Orissa. </font></p><p><font size="3"> All this happened, significantly, with the full approval of Jawaharlal Nehru than whom there hasn't been and cannot be a greater apostal of nonalignment. </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font>
