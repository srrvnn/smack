        <!-- Date: 19-09-2001 :: Pg: 12 :: Col: c --> </font></p><p><font size="3"> By Harish Khare </font></p><p><font size="3"> FOR THE first 96 hours after the horrendous terrorist attacks in New York, the Indian foreign policy constituency was in a tizzy. The barely disguised gleeful anticipation was that the Americans would now solve the Kashmir problem for us. Within hours of the tragedy in lower Manhattan, Mr. L.K. Advani was before the television cameras, hectoring in that `I have told you so many times' tone on the evils of terrorism. The more excitable among us believed that the Americans would look the other way should Indian commandos be let loose across the Line of Control in a mission to destroy jehadi camps. The more sober ones concluded that the Indians should drop all reservations about the United States and fully submerge not just our foreign policy priorities but even our national purpose with the objectives being redefined in Washington. </font></p><p><font size="3"> It did not take the Islamabad establishment long to bring us to back to reality by injecting conditionalities in the Pakistani collaboration with Washington in its new messianic preoccupation with Osama bin Laden. Our own Foreign Minister, Mr. Jaswant Singh, can pretend to be scandalised that the Pakistanis are trivialising the global war, but the Americans in their single- minded pursuit of the fugitive Saudi millionaire, are prepared to be respectful of the Pakistani sensitivities. The ghost of Ms. Robin Raphael remains unexorcised. If this kind of cultivated geopolitical duplicity was not unsettling enough, the attacks on the Sikh community in the U.S. have brought to the fore the dormant prejudices of American society at large. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The reassertion of these narrow Christian prejudices, the exposed fragility of the multi-cultural society, the reaffirmation by the U.S. President, Mr. George W. Bush, of the primacy of the American nation- state in total disregard of the principles and the presumed benefits of globalisation, and the need to rearrange the delicate balance between liberalism and the security threat from terrorism are only some of the issues that American society will have to sort out over the next few months and years. The current wisdom is that the world stands changed after September 11. Like the rest of the world, India will watch with considerable interest - as well as sympathy and fascination - how American institutions and interests are reworked to create a new order at home and abroad. </font></p><p><font size="3"> While the Americans will undertake the task of redefining and rediscovering themselves as constituting a nation of immigrants, we in India will also find ourselves called upon to stand up and be counted. As a country that for over a decade has suffered state-sponsored terrorism from across the border, no Indian, whatever his religion, should have any problem in understanding this particular American pain and even empathising with the desire for retribution; yet it is necessary that we make our foreign policy choices prudently, mindful of our own civilisational vulnerablities and opportunities. In particular, it is incumbent upon the wise men who rule in New Delhi to ensure that we do not allow ourselves to be sucked into another cycle of illiberality and brutalisation, needlessly generating domestic resentments and local grievances, while making our contribution to the global war against terrorism. </font></p><p><font size="3"> It has to be presumed that our reigning leadership knows that while collaborate we must with the U.S. in its war against Osama bin Laden and other known and unknown enemies, we have to avoid letting the Americans do to us what they did to Pakistan in the fight against the Soviets in Afghanistan. The consequences, of siding with the U.S. in the last Cold War battle against the Soviet Union, for Pakistani society are only too well- known; those consequences have had consequences for the neighbours, including India. The romanticisation of jehad and its sanctified commitment to violence can be traced to that time. Since 1980, Pakistan found itself on a one-way journey to jehad; its state institutions and agencies got conditioned by the theology of jehad. In the process Pakistan has developed all the symptoms of a ``failed state''. </font></p><p><font size="3"> It is irrelevant whether Pakistan had a choice in the matter of travelling the road to jehad, internal bigotry and state dysfunctionality, we certainly have a choice and an obligation not to travel that road. It would be bad enough if we allow our foreign policy choices to be unduly influenced by the current American itch for demonstrating a ``national will'', it would be worse and far too tragic if we allowed our domestic fundamentals to be dislocated by the American thirst for revenge. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Simply put each one of us must be totally unambiguous that my Muslim neighbour has not become a suspect as a potential terrorist just because ``Islam'' or ``Islamic fundamentalists'' were involved in settling in New York a few real or imaginary ``crimes'' of the U.S. The crux of the matter has been thoughtfully spelt out by the British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, in the House of Commons: ``We do not yet know the exact origin of this evil. But, if, as appears likely, it is so-called Islamic fundamentalists, we know they do not speak or act for the vast majority of decent law-abiding Muslims throughout the world. I say to our Arab and Muslim friends: neither you nor Islam is responsible for this; on the contrary, we know you share our shock at this terrorism; and we may ask you as a friend to make common cause with us in defeating this barbarism that is totally foreign to the true spirit and teaching of Islam.'' </font></p><p><font size="3"> Mr. Blair's wise words are no less relevant in India. This is not a question of choice between secularism or pseudo-secularism nor is this a matter of being pro or anti-U.S. If India has to contribute to the war against terrorism, we have an obligation to refine and enrich a truly pluralistic order at home, an order which each segment of society would find worth preserving, owing allegiance to and, if necessary, shedding blood for, an order in which the constable, not the goon, would maintain peace and the judge not the vigilante would dispense justice. </font></p><p><font size="3"> This has been the requirement all these years, more so now that those who justified and rationalised another destruction, on December 6, 1992, have come to man the ramparts of the Indian state. Now the destruction of the World Trade Center is being used to question the commitment to a constitutional order based on equality of faiths. The Bajrang Dal goons are busy lighting up minor fires of hate and divisiveness in various parts of country. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad continues with its agenda of dividing Hindus against Hindus, and Hindus against Muslims, while professional custodians of ``minority interests'' are not to be found wanting in coming up with an equally divisive response. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The struggle between the collective sanity of a liberal order and the sectarian frenzy of a besieged religiosity will continue to manifest itself differently in different parts of the world; as far as we in India are concerned, the rules of engagement will have to defined by us for ourselves rather than by the so-called ``international community''. In Jammu and Kashmir, in particular, we have no choice but to continue demonstrating that the Indian experiment is firm, fair and accommodating; only then can be defeated in the long run the jehadis, the Islamic fundamentalists as well as the misguided self-determinists (even if patronised from Washington). The U.S. may have discovered a new religion but it has not abandoned its old meddlesomeness which itself has encouraged and countenanced violence against this or that established authority. While we join in the war against terrorism we have to take care not to fall into the familiar trajectory of failed states. </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font>
