        <!-- Date: 20-09-2001 :: Pg: 01 :: Col: b --> </font></p><p><font size="3"> WASHINGTON, SEPT. 19. The U.S. Defense Department on Wednesday ordered combat aircraft to begin moving to bases in the Gulf area, the first concrete sign of preparations to retaliate for last week's terrorist attacks, a senior defence official said. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The combat aircraft will be preceded by teams of Air Force air controllers who will coordinate the refuelling of the fighters and bombers as they deploy from the United States to the Gulf region, the official said. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The deployment has been dubbed ``Operation Infinite Justice,'' the official said.One report said the U.S. Defense Secretary, Mr. Donald Rumsfeld had ordered more than 100 military aircraft to move toward the Middle East region. Likely to be included in the force of combat aircraft are F-16s, F-15s and possibly B-1 bombers. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The United States already has a sizable and well-developed military presence in the Gulf, with combat aircraft stationed in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and elsewhere. It appeared likely that many of the extra combat aircraft to be deployed in the next several days would go to Kuwait and Bahrain. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Earlier in the day, Mr. Rumsfeld said that America's war on terrorism must go beyond Osama bin Laden and hunt down associated networks of terrorists in dozens of countries. </font></p><p><font size="3"> ``We have a lot of evidence about a number of countries harbouring terrorists that are working across the globe,'' Mr. Rumsfeld told CNN television. </font></p><p><font size="3"> As Mr. Rumsfeld spoke, sailors and Marines on the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt and its battleship group prepared to leave Virginia for a long-scheduled deployment to the Mediterranean Sea. Officials declined to be specific about its ultimate destination. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Another carrier, the USS Enterprise, was scheduled to have returned home from the Gulf this month after the USS Carl Vinson arrived to relieve it, but the orders were changed and theEnterprise remained in the region. This could put three carrierbattle groups in the area within weeks. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Bush lining up global support </font></p><p><font size="3"> The White House, earlier, said the U.S. would not negotiate with Afghanistan's hardline Government for the handover of Osama bin Laden, main suspect in last week's terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, or members of his terrorist network. ``It's time for actions, not negotiations, with the Taliban,'' the spokesman, Mr. Ari Fleischer, said. He also ruled out presenting the United Nations with evidence of Osama bin Laden's involvement in the attack. </font></p><p><font size="3"> ``People who we are after would very much... love to remain in hiding, and know what we know and how we know it,'' the White House spokesman said. ``We're not about to do that.'' </font></p><p><font size="3"> The U.S. President, Mr. George W. Bush, is intensifying efforts to gain concrete support for a war on global terrorism, meeting with allies and making overtures toward nations that shelter some of the world's most notorious terrorist masterminds. </font></p><p><font size="3"> For countries with tenuous relationships with the U.S., the message was clear: Support a crackdown on terrorism or face U.S. retaliation. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Mr. Bush today met Ms. Megawati Sukarnoputri, President of Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation with 210 million people. </font></p><p><font size="3"> He called the South Korean President, Mr. Kim Dae-jung, who promised to participate in the international coalition, and the two leaders indicated they still planned to meet at an economic summit in Seoul next month. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Nature of support </font></p><p><font size="3"> At a joint Oval Office appearance with Ms. Megawati, Mr. Bush said he expected nations rallying to his international coalition to be involved in different ways. </font></p><p><font size="3"> ``Some nations will be comfortable supporting overt activities, some nations will be comfortable supporting covert activities, some nations will only be comfortable in providing information, others will be helpful and only feel comfortable helping on financial matters. I understand that,'' he said. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Mr. Bush met the French President, Mr. Jacques Chirac, late on Tuesday and won his backing. </font></p><p><font size="3"> ``We are of course prepared to be completely supportive of the United States and do whatever we (both nations) deem useful or necessary to reach the vital goal of eradicating terrorism,'' Mr. Chirac said during a joint appearance in the Oval Office. </font></p><p><font size="3"> A report from Berlin, quoted the German Chancellor, Mr. Gerhard Schroeder, as saying that his country was ready to take military risks in supporting the U.S., but concentrating exclusively on a military response would be ``fatal.'' </font></p><p><font size="3"> ``What we as Europeans and Germans aim for is unreserved solidarity with the United States in all necessary measures,'' Mr. Schroeder said in an address to Parliament today. ``Germany is ready to take risks, even military ones, but isn't prepared for adventures.'' </font></p><p><font size="3"> The Russian Foreign Minister, Mr. Igor Ivanov, said late on Tuesday after arriving in Washington: ``It is becoming an imperative - unification of efforts of all the international community in the fight against the terrorist threat.'' </font></p><p><font size="3"> In Tokyo, offering his support to Washington's campaign against terrorism, Japan's Prime Minister, Mr. Junichiro Koizumi, on Wednesday said his country may consider enacting a new law that would broaden the self-defence force's responsibilities in overseas conflicts. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Mr. Koizumi insisted that Japan would not change its pacifist Constitution, and that any legal revision would not involve putting Japanese soldiers into the battlefield. </font></p><p><font size="3"> But he opened the possibility of Japan contributing more - in terms of logistics and medical aid - to a coordinated attack by the U.S. and its allies against the perpetrators of the terror assaults. He also said Japan would consider offering aid to Pakistan. </font></p><p><font size="3"> In Washington, Mr. Bush on Tuesday signed into law a $40 billion package, most of which will go to recovery efforts in New York City, Washington and southwestern Pennsylvania - where four hijacked planes crashed last week, killing thousands of people - and to battle terrorism. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The President also put his signature to the congressional resolution authorising him to use military force against the terrorists responsible for the attacks. </font></p><p><font size="3"> White House apologises </font></p><p><font size="3"> Mr. Bush has expressed regret over having used the word ``crusade,'' with all its historical connotations of religious war, to describe his campaign against terrorists. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Mr. Fleischer said on Tuesday that Mr. Bush only meant to say that his was a ``broad cause'' to stamp out terrorism worldwide. </font></p><p><font size="3"> ``I think to the degree that that word has any connotations that would upset any of our partners or anybody else in the world, the President would regret if anything like that was conveyed. But the purpose of his conveying it is in the traditional English sense of the word, it's a broad cause,'' said Mr. Fleischer. </font></p><p><font size="3"> On Sunday, Mr. Bush had told reporters: ``This crusade, this war on terrorism is going to take a while.'' With that comment, he stoked suspicion in some Arab and Muslim quarters where crusade is a loaded term that recalls the Christians' medieval wars against Muslims in the Holy Land. </font></p><p><font size="3"> - AP, AFP, Reuters </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font>
