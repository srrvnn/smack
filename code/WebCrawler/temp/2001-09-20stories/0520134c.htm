        <!-- Date: 20-09-2001 :: Pg: 11 :: Col: f --> </font></p><p><font size="3"> By C. Raja Mohan </font></p><p><font size="3"> NEW DELHI, SEPT. 19. As the United States builds an international coalition to pursue its new war against terror, it has to inevitably cope with the different agendas that the allies bring with them. Some of these clash with proclaimed American goals in other areas and there will be contradictions among the different interests of the potential allies. </font></p><p><font size="3"> This tension is already visible in the subcontinent, where Pakistan offers to support the American actions against the Taliban regime, but wants to limit the forward movement in Indo- U.S. relations, salvage some of its interests in Afghanistan, regain economic support from the U.S., and leverage renewed American connection against India. </font></p><p><font size="3"> New Delhi's own enthusiastic support to the American war plans is based on the hope that the latest U.S. commitment to fight international terrorism - root and branch - will eventually lead to the draining of the swamps of extremism in Pakistan and Afghanistan. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Pakistan and India are not alone in this. Russia which is holding talks with the Bush administration this week in Moscow on counter-terrorism will look to promote its own interests. As it helps America fight its terrorists, Moscow would certainly want American support in crushing the extremists in the rebellious province of Chechnya. </font></p><p><font size="3"> China, too, has suggested that it may back the American war against terrorism, if Washington lets Beijing pursue its own campaign against separatism in Taiwan, Tibet and Xinjiang. There can be no ``double-standards'', in the struggle against terrorism, a Chinese spokesman said on Tuesday. </font></p><p><font size="3"> But can't the U.S., the most powerful nation the world has ever seen, fight this war on its own without compromising its other interests? Does it really need allies with agendas? </font></p><p><font size="3"> The answers to these questions rest in the profoundly transformed security condition of the U.S. last week. The U.S. must now adapt itself to the vulnerabilities at home. Since 1812, when British forces raided Washington, no one had dared to hit the U.S. heartland. All that changed on September 11, 2001. </font></p><p><font size="3"> For about two centuries, Washington had pursued its global and regional objectives in Europe and Asia, with the absolute sense of security at home. America no longer has that luxury. As it tries to re-secure its homeland, Washington needs to accommodate allies and friends as never before. </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> All the key players, who can influence the situation in the region or help the U.S. effectively pursue its new war, have their own separate interests at stake. Whether it is Russia, China, Pakistan, India, Israel or moderate Arab nations, every one of them would want to promote or protect their own interests in supporting the American war. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The extent of the gains will depend on their bargaining power, which in turn is based on internal strength, geopolitical location and the resources they can bring to the table. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Pakistan, which has become so crucial to the pursuit of this war, could have gained enormously. But its internal weaknesses have left it with little capacity to bargain effectively with the U.S. </font></p><p><font size="3"> More fundamentally, Pakistan has emerged as part of America's new security problem. The sources of America's internal vulnerability lie in the breeding ground of extremism and terrorism that Pakistan has tended in the last two decades. </font></p><p><font size="3"> It is logical to assume that the U.S. cannot eliminate the threats to its security while leaving Pakistan free to retain its terrorist leverage against India. </font></p><p><font size="3"> But there may be no shortage of American policy makers looking for short-term fixes in Pakistan and Afghanistan. But it is precisely that approach - during the 1980s and 1990s - which has landed the U.S. in its present security predicament. </font></p><p><font size="3"> There is an unquestionable convergence of Indian and American long-term strategic interests in the region - rooting out terrorism and pushing Pakistan towards moderation and modernisation. </font></p><p><font size="3"> There will be an opportunity this week to sort out any misperceptions on the short-term tactical questions relating to Pakistan, when the national security adviser, Mr. Brajesh Mishra, meets the top echelons of the U.S. establishment in Washington. </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font>
