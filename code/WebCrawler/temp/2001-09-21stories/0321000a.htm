        <!-- Date: 21-09-2001 :: Pg: 13 :: Col: a --> </font></p><p><font size="3"> By B. Muralidhar Reddy </font></p><p><font size="3"> ISLAMABAD, SEPT. 20. Tomorrow would be a testing day for the military Government in Pakistan as religious parties and groups have called for a nation-wide general strike in protest against a possible retaliatory strikes by the U.S. against the Taliban regime using Pakistan's airbases. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The Musharraf Government can draw solace from the fact that the leaders of the religious parties have promised to ensure a peaceful protest and not to allow the situation to go out of control. And, as of now, the military is in command notwithstanding the rhetoric from a variety of hard-liners and those who are bitterly opposed to the idea of allowing the U.S. forces to operate from the Pakistani soil. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The Jamaat-e-Islami chief, Quazi Hussain Ahmed, who addressed a news conference here today, gave a distinct impression that he was not at all impressed with the logic put forth by the Pakistan President, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, in defence of the decision to ditch the Taliban and side with the U.S. in its fight against terrorism. At the same time, he was at pains to assure the Government that the protests would be peaceful. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Gen. Musharraf's 45-minute address to the nation on Wednesday appears to have been targeted at those who are miffed over the decision of the military Government to implement the U.S. agenda on Osama bin Laden and the Taliban. Quoting profusely from the Holy Quran, Gen. Musharraf sought to remind his critics that bravery without thinking was stupidity. </font></p><p><font size="3"> He sought to impress upon them that never was Pakistan faced with such a critical situation since 1971 when it suffered dismemberment following the birth of Bangladesh. Gen. Musharraf tried to make out a forceful case that the very unity and integrity of Pakistan could be at stake if wrong decisions were made. </font></p><p><font size="3"> ``At this time, we have to make sure that our enemies do not succeed in their designs to harm us. Pakistan is regarded as a fort of Islam. If this is damaged, Islam will be damaged. I ask you to trust me, like you trusted me when I went to Agra. May Allah guide and protect us,'' he told the nation. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Despite the best efforts of the Pakistan President to take every one on board at this critical juncture, the rhetoric from the hard-liners continues to be high. This is evident from a number of statements from the religious leaders particularly those close to the Taliban. The Chairman of the Council for Defence of Pakistan and Afghanistan, Maulana Samiul Haq, has said if Gen. Musharraf takes any decision in the interest of the U.S. rather than national interest, it would be dangerous for the country. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Mr. Haq has complained that for the last 53 years the country had been under slavery in the name of larger national interests. Paid servants of the U.S., who are working as advisers of the Government could not give him better suggestions. Problems of the people could not be resolved by keeping the begging bowl full of dollars, Mr. Haq added. </font></p><p><font size="3"> At a meet-the-press programme at Rawalpindi, Mr. Haq said that ``presently the Govt. of Pakistan and the President are under immense pressure and we are doing everything to encourage them''. The people of the country would support the Government if it was ready to defend the country, but how could they support those, who want to make Pakistan a ``hired killer'' in exchange of dollars and credits. </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font>
