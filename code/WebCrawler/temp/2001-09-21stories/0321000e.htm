        <!-- Date: 21-09-2001 :: Pg: 16 :: Col: b --> </font></p><p><font size="3"> By Hasan Suroor </font></p><p><font size="3"> LONDON, SEPT. 20. Stepping up his efforts to rally European support for U.S. action against terrorists ahead of the launch of ``Operation Infinite Justice'', the British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair said today British forces were most likely to be involved in any military strikes. He also expected other European countries to join in what Britain sees as the start of a long and determined fight against international terrorism. His statement coincided with an opinion poll indicating that 70 per cent Britons back strong military offensive against countries suspected to be helping terrorists. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Mr. Blair, who was speaking in Paris during the second leg of his transatlantic shuttle diplomacy, said while the precise nature of ``our response'' was under discussion British participation was almost certain. He stressed that those who were in a position to help in bringing to justice the people responsible for last week's terrorist attacks in the U.S. should do so. His remarks came after a meeting this morning with the French President, Mr. Jacques Chirac who is known to have reservations about an overtly aggressive reprisal. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The continuing French unease over giving a carte blanche to Washington was reflected in Mr. Chirac's comment that his country would support an ``appropriate'' response. ``I can't see how France and Britain would not be involved if it was appropriate,'' he said answering a question from the media. This is also the message he is believed to have conveyed to the U.S. President, Mr. George W Bush as well when he met him in Washington earlier this week. </font></p><p><font size="3"> His offer of ``unwavering'' French solidarity was tempered with a call for restraint, a line favoured by most European countries. Even Britain, seen as the most ``hawkish'' of U.S. allies, is reported to be advising restraint in private and Mr. Blair echoed this saying any action would be decided ``calmly'' and in a ``considered way.'' </font></p><p><font size="3"> Mr. Blair, who was on his way to meet Mr. Bush today, is engaged in a hectic diplomatic campaign to get Europe fall in line with the U.S. as it prepares for the long haul in its bid to track down the perpetrators of the September 11 carnage. On Wednesday, he had discussions with the German Chancellor, Mr. Gerhard Schroeder who is under pressure from his coalition partners, the Greens, to tread cautiously. He is believed to have assured Mr. Blair of full German support for what The Guardian termed as ``purposeful military action''. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Much attention was today focussed on Mr. Blair's talks with Mr. Bush amid reports that London and Washington were working on a long-term strategy to destroy terrorist networks around the world. The Times disclosed a ``secret'' British-U.S. plan to launch a 10-year ``war on terrorism'' called ``Operation Noble Eagle'' - a combination of diplomatic and military muscle backed by economic and political pressures. It quoted defence sources as saying that the current build-up of American forces in the Gulf would not necessarily lead to a ``D- Day invasion of Afghanistan'' and ``no repeat'' of the 1991 Operation Desert Storm against Iraq. They said the planned campaign was not aimed at just bringing Osama bin Laden to ``justice''. </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font>
