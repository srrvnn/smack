        <!-- Date: 23-09-2001 :: Pg: 24 :: Col: a --> </font></p><p><font size="3"> FROM very early on in the turbulent history of the human race, great, apparently indestructible cities have been attacked by enemies and destroyed. Afterwards, always, people have turned to mythology and poetry to know how these catastrophes happened. The oldest descriptions, like Homer's verses on Troy, all contain the same powerful image, one that evokes a response of horror and awe: that of towers that once dominated a civilised city, falling and burning. </font></p><p><font size="3"> For generations those ancient towers have been falling and burning in the subconscious mind of mankind. They have now become the first truly powerful image of the new millennium. Nobody who watched the destruction of the twin towers in New York will ever forget it as a spectacle or a symbol. New York was not destroyed, but part of a civilisation and its concepts fell when the towers fell. </font></p><p><font size="3"> I can see only one advantage in growing old. Since I am a journalist, I have witnessed events that, when connected, become in my mind almost a genealogy of the world's present anger and grief, and can describe them. In 1961 I first visited Israel. The Eichmann trial was on and in the courtroom I learnt, firsthand, what the Jews had suffered under Hitler. I moved around the tiny country and saw how the refugees had made the desert flower, and how the kibbutzes worked. An atmosphere of selflessness prevailed. Israel was surrounded and hugely outnumbered by Arab armies, who daily declared that their intention was to drive the Jews into the sea. </font></p><p><font size="3"> I was there more than a year. I once visited a kibbutz on the Syrian border 20 minutes after Arab infiltrators - not then known as terrorists - had called by. They blew up the school and the hospital and fled. Bits and pieces of children and old people were scattered around like parts of mistreated dolls. The air smelt of blood, human excrement and cordite, and everyone was weeping. </font></p><p><font size="3"> I made many friends in Israel. David Ben Gurion, the Prime Minister, used to talk to me because I was the youngest correspondent at the trial and also the only Indian. He said this situation was not what the Zionist movement had meant. What it had meant was that Jews should peacefully develop their farms and settlements alongside the Arabs in Palestine. This was what had happened in the early decades of the 20th Century. The Jews had come slowly and in peace. The Second World War and the Holocaust had changed things. Jews had flooded into Palestine and the State of Israel only came into existence after a war. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Ben Gurion wanted to talk to Nehru. He was hurt that Nehru, who had declared himself an unconditional supporter of the Arabs, would not talk to him. &quot;I admire him. If I could explain our position to him, and he explained it to the Arabs, perhaps the prospects of peace would be better. But we have no diplomatic relations with India, and he will not speak to me.&quot; This grieved him. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Later, advised by the Israeli painter Yosl Bergner, I watched, through binoculars, a Palestinian refugee camp across the Jordan River. This camp was, as Bergner had told me, like Auschwitz, with skeletal people amidst decrepit shacks, ragged children whose huge eyes were full of splintered reflections. </font></p><p><font size="3"> In 1967 I came back for the Six-Day War. It was the first time the Israelis had taken the offensive. Their forces swept into Arab territory and occupied it. I was there when the Old City of Jerusalem was taken, and also accompanied the Israeli troops into Bethlehem and Jericho. Ben Gurion was dead, and I didn't meet as many friends as I wanted to. One whom I did meet, that fine poet Carmi, said, &quot;Maybe we've taught the Arabs not to kill our civilians, but now we must talk peace. We must give back the land we took.&quot; I repeated this to a senior Israeli officer. He replied incredulously, &quot;Give it back?&quot; He thought the idea insane. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Five years later I sat on a slope above a valley in Vietnam. It was to be &quot;swept&quot;, since the Viet Cong were thought to be hiding in the clumps of trees between the sunlit paddy fields. I was with some young black soldiers. They were all high on drugs. &quot;Whitey sendin' us down in the first attack wave, man,&quot; one of them said. &quot;We ain't comin' out.&quot; He gave me a Harlem address. &quot;Y'ever go there, tell my folks how you met me.&quot; An hour later his platoon went into the valley and was wiped out by heavy VC fire as soon as it reached the first clump of trees. </font></p><p><font size="3"> That war divided many American blacks from their white compatriots. After the troops went home, often with drug habits, some blacks converted to Islam, and shed the names that white slavemasters, centuries before, had given them. A population of West Asian Muslims also exists in the U.S.. These are internal matters that the warchiefs in the wounded Pentagon must have considered. </font></p><p><font size="3"> But the most important lesson learned by the terrorists from the 1980s onward was also learnt in Vietnam. A developed nation finds guerrilla tactics hard to combat. The terrorists are urban guerrillas with access to high technology. The VC planted explosives or poisoned punji stakes in booby traps. The contemporary terrorist crashes 767s in the great cities of the world. While the American armed forces fight in Afghanistan, further crises may occur at home. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The world now confronts a crisis. This might have been averted at several points as the calendars flapped by, had a handful of men, including Jawaharlal Nehru, troubled to talk to each other as human beings rather than political animals. E. M. Forster once said, sensibly, as was his wont, &quot;Only connect.&quot; Much grief is in store. But its genealogy and nature are connected to what the eyes of Palestinian children said by the Jordan River, nearly half a century ago. </font></p><p><font size="3"> DOM MORAES </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font>
