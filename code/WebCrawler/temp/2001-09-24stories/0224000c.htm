        <!-- Date: 24-09-2001 :: Pg: 14 :: Col: e --> </font></p><p><font size="3"> By Our Special Correspondent </font></p><p><font size="3"> LUCKNOW, SEPT. 23. The Union Home Minister, Mr. L.K. Advani, today urged the country to remain in a state of readiness to face eventualities as was recently witnessed by the U.S. The situation caused by terrorism in India was grave and people should be ready to face it with a sense of unity and solidarity. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Speaking at a function organised to release a special issue on border security brought out by a Hindi magazine Rashtra Dharma, Mr. Advani said India should take a lesson from the U.S. which unitedly took the challenge posed by terrorism. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The U.S. media, political parties and people at large instantly realised the gravity of the situation and supported their government without a murmur. People only thought of accepting the challenge and not to criticise the government for its failures to prevent the terrorist strikes. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Mr. Advani said terrorists challenging the Indian state were not on their own. They were being offered positive support by Pakistan. And cross-border terrorism was only a war of a different kind which could be dealt with only as such. </font></p><p><font size="3"> He said for the past several years, India had been drawing the attention of the world community to the problem of terrorism faced by it. Its concerns, however, could not get desired attention from others. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Now the U.S. itself had been hit by terrorism and realised the need for international efforts to face the problem. By seeking world support to fight terrorism, the U.S. had only supported the Indian point of view. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The U.S. situation, he said, had forced the world to sit up and think over the gravity of the problem. It was rather the U.S. which had come to support Indian view point on this question instead of India going to toe its line, the Union Home Minister said. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Mr. Advani said India had expressed its support to the U.S. but no specific assistance had been sought by the latter so far except for sharing some intelligence reports. What kind of help India would extend would be examined when the question actually came up, he said. </font></p><p><font size="3"> He expressed satisfaction over the turn of events following terrorist strikes in the U.S. It was well known that Pakistan was nurturing terrorism on its soil. Now the country itself had been put to oppose terrorism. Situation was changing on its own and there was no question of India opting for bargaining on any issue. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Mr. Advani welcomed the statement by the U.S. Secretary of State, Gen. Colin Powell, that the campaign against global terrorism also meant war against terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The fight against terrorism should not be considered to be directed against any religion, community or particular country. It was between forces of democracy and those opposed to it. </font></p><p><font size="3"> He justified his recent statement in which he had pleaded to grant general amnesty to security personnel who were facing charges of excesses during their campaign against terrorists in Punjab. War situation was a situation of emergency in general. </font></p><p><font size="3"> And during war many of normal legal rights were put to suspension. It was necessary to examine the intention of security personnel during their campaign while considering charges against them, he added. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Pak. trying to bargain with U.S. </font></p><p><font size="3"> PTI reports from New Delhi: </font></p><p><font size="3"> Pakistan may be ``trying to bargain'' with the U.S. in the process of joining the global fight against terrorism, Mr. Advani said. </font></p><p><font size="3"> ``Pakistan may be trying to sell something at the moment, trying to strike deals, trying to negotiate, bargain. We are not doing it because it's not we who are responding to the Americans....'' he told Mr. Seed Naqvi for the World Report programme on Doordarshan. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Stating that the U.S. concentration on Osama Bin laden and the Taliban was ``understandable'', he said ``I only hope America realises that most of the (terrorist) networks are indivisible. Most of them sustain themselves by relying on each other''. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Mr. Advani made light of the U.S. equating the Irish Republican Army with the Lashkar-e-Taiba and the Jaish-e-Mohammad in its list of terrorist organisations. ``I found the list of terrorist organisations named by the U.S. in its annual report, but not proscribed''. </font></p><p><font size="3"> While the U.S. kept the LeT and the JeM on the list of terrorist outfits ``it did not ban them''. </font></p><p><font size="3"> If Bajrang Dal is supposed to be a terrorist organisation, then ``it is a joke'', Mr. Advani said. Asked to comment on a media report recommending closure of Bajrang Dal camps as part of India's fight against terrorism, he said ``sometimes I wonder what this Bajrang Dal camp is. </font></p><p><font size="3"> ``Because when I ask people associated with it, they say we train people in using air guns. So if that is supposed to be a terrorist organisation, it is a joke,'' Mr. Advani said. </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font>
