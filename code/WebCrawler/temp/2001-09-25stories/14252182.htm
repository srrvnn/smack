        <!-- Date: 25-09-2001 :: Pg: 03 :: Col: a --> </font></p><p><font size="3"> Police add to chaos </font></p><p><font size="3"> By Gaurav Vivek Bhatnagar </font></p><p><font size="3"> East Delhi may be the most congested of places in the Capital. With a large human and vehicular population, its roads may be choking. But that does not prevent police personnel in the area from adding to the chaos by obstructing the flow of traffic. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Their actions verging on absurdity, quite often police personnel in East Delhi can be seen putting up barricades -- and leaving them there -- for routine checks. And while their actions put the traffic in a bind, the personnel seem only interested in pestering the two-wheeler riders or bus drivers for obvious reasons. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Be it the busy Vikas Marg near the Laxmi Nagar chungi or the police post near the School Block railway overbridge at Shakarpur, at numerous places in East Delhi one finds personnel just standing near the barricades and disrupting the traffic flow. While their actions may appear justifiable when a drive against criminals is on, normally their actions themselves reflect on their care-little attitude. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Even as the traffic flow falls prey to their ill-conceived plans, these personnel just stand around looking for easy ``prey''. And if their idea is only to check driving licences and permits, surely there are numerous places where they can carry out such checks without inconveniencing the public. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Also, by leaving the barricades on the roads, these personnel pose a clear and present danger to motorists, especially two- wheeler riders, who may just ram into these structures in the dark. </font></p><p><font size="3"> But safety and comfort of the public appears to be the last thing on their minds and of their superiors who, ironically, are part of a police force which works on the principle of ``With You, For You, Always''. </font></p><p><font size="3"> * * * </font></p><p><font size="3"> Some humour </font></p><p><font size="3"> By K. Kannan </font></p><p><font size="3"> At about the same time as Osama Bin Laden was reported missing in Kabul, mediapersons in Delhi received an urgent call for help from Toon Headquarters informing that the Indian kids' favourite cartoon star and the network's canine detective, Scooby-Doo, has not reported for work since Sunday morning! </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> The fax that was received in newspaper offices proved that promotional drives inside Delhi have gone crazy and marketing brains are working overtime to create events out of nothing. Anyway, this particular release had this to add : According to sources at the Toon Headquarters, Scooby-Doo disappeared on Sunday and, after waiting for a few hours, a preliminary search was carried out. </font></p><p><font size="3"> Strangely, he was not found at any of the burger joints, ice- cream parlours or food plazas and had not even touched any of the Scooby snacks in the Cartoon Network Studio pantry. All of us at the network, added the release, are in a state of panic because of Scooby-Doo's disappearance. All his shows had to be cancelled. </font></p><p><font size="3"> ``While we are trying to get some substitutes, it won't be the same without Scooby-Doo. We are all very worried about him and request you to please invite all Scooby-Doo fans and Cartoon Network viewers to keep a look out for Scooby'' was the appeal that went out. </font></p><p><font size="3"> And here in lies the bait. In case anyone has either seen or heard from Scooby-Doo, they should immediately write to the Scooby Search Cell at cartoon Network or log on to www.cartoonnetworkindia.com........ </font></p><p><font size="3"> * * * </font></p><p><font size="3"> Dazzling show </font></p><p><font size="3"> By Lalit K. Jha </font></p><p><font size="3"> ``Amazing!'', ``Excellent!'' and ``Unimaginable!'' is how people visiting the National Museum to have a glimpse of Nizam's Jewellery, have reacted after availing of the once-in-a-life time opportunity to see the dazzling display. </font></p><p><font size="3"> In an attempt to record these observations, the authorities have kept a Visitor's Book at the reception. ``I have seen many collections all over the world, but this collection surpasses all,'' wrote one Mr. Surya Mohan from Jaipur. ``Excellent collection, but we need some more time to go through the exhibits,'' wrote Mr. Joff Kishman. </font></p><p><font size="3"> ``An amazingly beautiful collection, but the time for viewing is too short. Increase the ticket cost and time allowed,'' wrote Nilofer Kalra, a visitor from Geneva. ``This exhibition requires no comment. It is beyond our imagination,'' observed Mr. Chaman Lal Gupta, the Union Minister. </font></p><p><font size="3"> However, there were still a few who felt the display was not up to the mark. ``Fantastic jewellery but terrible display,'' wrote painter Jatin Das. While others said it should be exhibited at other cities like Mumbai also. </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> The best comment seems to be from Neha Jewellery: ``I think all kings and Nizam's were mad about jewelleries. But this madness has left a beautiful and marvelous gift for the country.'' </font></p><p><font size="3"> * * * </font></p><p><font size="3"> Pestering lot </font></p><p><font size="3"> By Bindu Jacob </font></p><p><font size="3"> Walk out with a couple of foreigners in the city and you will realise how much of harassment they have to put up with, whether they realise it or not. As for the country's image, it certainly goes for a toss. </font></p><p><font size="3"> The first thing that happens when you have a foreigner by your side is that an avalanche of auto drivers surround you talking about the places you should visit, the route to take and the fare that they would render their services for. </font></p><p><font size="3"> If you dare turn down the deal, a small line of drivers would follow you through the streets trying to strike a deal, shouting at the top of their voice. And even as you walk through a crowded street, you have a ``small procession'' following you, arguing with you one time and almost simultaneously having a heated argument amongst themselves. The worst, of course, is when you turn around and ask them to leave you alone. </font></p><p><font size="3"> ``This is why our country never progresses. Indians are protecting foreigners when they should make them pay for entering our city,'' they yell, shouting the choicest of abuses. And they continue: ``If you want a small cut in the fare, just tell us and we will arrange. Both of us can earn in this deal, after all both are Indians.'' </font></p><p><font size="3"> You escape them only to be caught by tourist guides, snake charmers, beggars and urchins. Of course, the fun continues uninterrupted. </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font></p><p><font size="3"> </font>
